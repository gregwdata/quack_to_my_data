# LLaMA 2 Chatbot App âš¡

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/gregwdata/quack_to_my_data?quickstart=1)

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

This is a project meant to get hands-on with the concept of using an LLM to engage with a database.

It will use a local instance of ðŸ¦† DuckDB to store some sample data sets. It will serve as a vehicle for exploring different approaches to guide the AI to produce correct and useful queries against the dataset.

Development will initially be centered around running in GitHub Codespaces
