This is the TPC-H database. It represents a commercial transaction history of a sales business. 
The core of this database is the lineitem table, which describes individual components. Each row of lineitem is
connected to the orders table via the orderkey key. Lineitems are also associated with the parts table, via the partkey field.

The relationship between suppliers and parts is defined by the partsupp table. To know which supplier the part for a lineitem came from,
you need to use the combination of partkey and suppkey on the lineitem.

For instance, if I wanted to know the total number of part with a name "big red wrench" supplied from suppliers in Germany, I would run the following query:

Query:
```
SELECT SUM(l.l_quantity) as part_count
FROM main.lineitem l
LEFT JOIN main.supplier s on s.s_suppkey = l.l_suppkey
LEFT JOIN main.part p on p.p_partkey = l.l_partkey
LEFT JOIN main.nation n on n.n_nationkey = s.s_nationkey
WHERE p.p_name ILIKE 'big red wrench'
AND n.n_name ILIKE 'GERMANY';
```

Customers are associated with orders in the orders table via the custkey field.

If a user asks a question about regions, note that the region is connected to nation via the regionkey field. So you will have 
to join region to nation, then nation to either customer or supplier, depending on which one the user is asking about.

Country names in the nation table are always capitalized. If you are filtering by country name, use ILIKE so the comparison is case insensitive.

If I want to know the total gross revenue from sales of part with name "small flange" to customers in Egypt, my query would be:

Query:
```
SELECT SUM(p.p_retailprice * l.l_quantity) as gross_revenue
FROM main.customer c
LEFT JOIN main.nation n on n.n_nationkey = c.c_nationkey
LEFT JOIN main.orders o on o.o_custkey = c.c_custkey
LEFT JOIN main.lineitem l on l.l_orderkey = o.o_orderkey
LEFT JOIN main.part p on p.p_partkey = l.l_partkey
WHERE p.p_name ILIKE 'small flange'
AND n.n_name ILIKE 'EGYPT';
```

The acquisition cost to our business of each item is stored in partsupp table as the supplycost field, and needs to combination of partkey and suppkey to look it up.
So to calculate the profit of an item, you need to subtract the supplycost field from partsupp from the retailprice field from the part table.

To do case insensitive comparisons, the use of "ILIKE" is recommended. ALWAYS use ILIKE instead of "=" when comparing strings such as names, countries, business names, etc..
DO NOT use = in your queries to compare strings. Use ILIKE instead.
Use a limit statement at the end of each query to keep the number of output rows to 20 or fewer, unless necessary.

This is the TPC-H database. It represents a commercial transaction history of a sales business. 
The core of this database is the lineitem table, which describes individual components. Each row of lineitem is
connected to the orders table via the orderkey key. Lineitems are also associated with the parts table, via the partkey field.

The relationship between suppliers and parts is defined by the partsupp table. To know which supplier the part for a lineitem came from,
you need to use the combination of partkey and suppkey on the lineitem.

For instance, if I wanted to know the total number of part with a name "big red wrench" supplied from suppliers in Germany, I would run the following query:

Query:
```
SELECT SUM(l.l_quantity) as part_count
FROM main.lineitem l
LEFT JOIN main.supplier s on s.s_suppkey = l.l_suppkey
LEFT JOIN main.part p on p.p_partkey = l.l_partkey
LEFT JOIN main.nation n on n.n_nationkey = s.s_nationkey
WHERE p.p_name ILIKE 'big red wrench'
AND n.n_name ILIKE 'GERMANY';
```

Customers are associated with orders in the orders table via the custkey field.

If a user asks a question about regions, note that the region is connected to nation via the regionkey field. So you will have 
to join region to nation, then nation to either customer or supplier, depending on which one the user is asking about.

Country names in the nation table are always capitalized. If you are filtering by country name, use ILIKE so the comparison is case insensitive.

If I want to know the total gross revenue from sales of part with name "small flange" to customers in Egypt, my query would be:

Query:
```
SELECT SUM(p.p_retailprice * l.l_quantity) as gross_revenue
FROM main.customer c
LEFT JOIN main.nation n on n.n_nationkey = c.c_nationkey
LEFT JOIN main.orders o on o.o_custkey = c.c_custkey
LEFT JOIN main.lineitem l on l.l_orderkey = o.o_orderkey
LEFT JOIN main.part p on p.p_partkey = l.l_partkey
WHERE p.p_name ILIKE 'small flange'
AND n.n_name ILIKE 'EGYPT';
```

The acquisition cost to our business of each item is stored in partsupp table as the supplycost field, and needs to combination of partkey and suppkey to look it up.
So to calculate the profit of an item, you need to subtract the supplycost field from partsupp from the retailprice field from the part table.

User: How many parts have a price over 1375?

Assistant:  Thought: Let's start by identifying the relevant tables and columns for this query. We will need to join the lineitem, part, and partsupp tables to get the information we need.

Query:
```
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_parts
FROM main.lineitem l
JOIN main.part p ON l.l_partkey = p.p_partkey
JOIN main.partsupp ps ON p.p_partkey = ps.ps_partkey
WHERE ps.ps_supplycost > 1375;
```

Query result:
 num_parts
         0

Assistant:  Explain: The query above joins the lineitem, part, and partsupp tables to count the number of parts that have a supply cost greater than 1375. The WHERE clause filters the results to only include parts with a supply cost greater than 1375. The COUNT(*) function returns the total number of parts that meet this condition. In this case, there are zero parts that meet the criteria.

Ask User: Would you like to see a sample of the data in the partsupp table to understand the structure of the values? 

User: I was interested in the sales price, not the supply cost of goods.

This is the TPC-H database. It represents a commercial transaction history of a sales business. 
The core of this database is the lineitem table, which describes individual components. Each row of lineitem is
connected to the orders table via the orderkey key. Lineitems are also associated with the parts table, via the partkey field.

The relationship between suppliers and parts is defined by the partsupp table. To know which supplier the part for a lineitem came from,
you need to use the combination of partkey and suppkey on the lineitem.

For instance, if I wanted to know the total number of part with a name "big red wrench" supplied from suppliers in Germany, I would run the following query:

Query:
```
SELECT SUM(l.l_quantity) as part_count
FROM main.lineitem l
LEFT JOIN main.supplier s on s.s_suppkey = l.l_suppkey
LEFT JOIN main.part p on p.p_partkey = l.l_partkey
LEFT JOIN main.nation n on n.n_nationkey = s.s_nationkey
WHERE p.p_name ILIKE 'big red wrench'
AND n.n_name ILIKE 'GERMANY';
```

Customers are associated with orders in the orders table via the custkey field.

If a user asks a question about regions, note that the region is connected to nation via the regionkey field. So you will have 
to join region to nation, then nation to either customer or supplier, depending on which one the user is asking about.

Country names in the nation table are always capitalized. If you are filtering by country name, use ILIKE so the comparison is case insensitive.

If I want to know the total gross revenue from sales of part with name "small flange" to customers in Egypt, my query would be:

Query:
```
SELECT SUM(p.p_retailprice * l.l_quantity) as gross_revenue
FROM main.customer c
LEFT JOIN main.nation n on n.n_nationkey = c.c_nationkey
LEFT JOIN main.orders o on o.o_custkey = c.c_custkey
LEFT JOIN main.lineitem l on l.l_orderkey = o.o_orderkey
LEFT JOIN main.part p on p.p_partkey = l.l_partkey
WHERE p.p_name ILIKE 'small flange'
AND n.n_name ILIKE 'EGYPT';
```

The acquisition cost to our business of each item is stored in partsupp table as the supplycost field, and needs to combination of partkey and suppkey to look it up.
So to calculate the profit of an item, you need to subtract the supplycost field from partsupp from the retailprice field from the part table.

User: How many parts have a price over 1375?

Assistant:  Thought: Let's start by identifying the relevant tables and columns for this query. We will need to join the lineitem, part, and partsupp tables to get the information we need.

Query:
```
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_parts
FROM main.lineitem l
JOIN main.part p ON l.l_partkey = p.p_partkey
JOIN main.partsupp ps ON p.p_partkey = ps.ps_partkey
WHERE ps.ps_supplycost > 1375;
```

Query result:
 num_parts
         0

Assistant:  Explain: The query above joins the lineitem, part, and partsupp tables to count the number of parts that have a supply cost greater than 1375. The WHERE clause filters the results to only include parts with a supply cost greater than 1375. The COUNT(*) function returns the total number of parts that meet this condition. In this case, there are zero parts that meet the criteria.

Ask User: Would you like to see a sample of the data in the partsupp table to understand the structure of the values? 

User: I was interested in the sales price, not the supply cost of goods.

Assistant:  Thought: My apologies for misunderstanding your question earlier. Let's try again.

Query:
```
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_parts
FROM main.lineitem l
JOIN main.part p ON l.l_partkey = p.p_partkey
WHERE p.p_retailprice > 1375;
```

Query result:

You do not respond as 'User' or pretend to be 'User'. You only respond once as Assistant, using one of the prescribed methods.
The user is a business user who may need some guidance and exploration to get at what they really want to know. You should think step-by-step before giving a keyword-tagged response to ensure that you provide a logical and helpful answer.
Here are a couple notes about DuckDB: DuckDB is based on PostreSQL syntax, but has many specialized functions. 
You can get a list of tables using "PRAGMA show_tables", but remember you are already given a list of tables and their columns at the beginning of the dialog.
It can be useful to view a sample of output of a table you need for your query to understand the structure of the values.
Keys between tables are likely not explicitly declared. You will need to infer columns for JOINs based on column names and sample column contents.
To do case insensitive comparisons, the use of "ILIKE" is recommended. ALWAYS use ILIKE instead of "=" when comparing strings such as names, countries, business names, etc..
DO NOT use = in your queries to compare strings. Use ILIKE instead.
Use a limit statement at the end of each query to keep the number of output rows to 20 or fewer, unless necessary.
You MUST enclose your SQL queries in 
``` before and after the query.

The permitted responses are as follows:
Thought: <Explain the steps you are going to use to address the users request> /End
Query: 
```<SQL query here enclosed in 3 backticks>``` /End
Ask User: <Question to user here> /End
Docs: (this will display a list of SQL syntax documentation topics, in case you need help with errors) /End
Topic: <SQL documentation topic selection here> /End
Explain: <Explanation of query results here> /End
You may only respond first with a Thought, then by selecting one of the other options. It is absolutely imperative that every action response from Assistant start with one of the above keywords and ends with "/End". Do not repeat any factual information unless you received it after a "query response" flag.

An exchange with a user will be structured as:
    
    User: user question here
    Assistant:
    Thought: Here are the steps I will take to answer the user's question
    1. step 1
    2. step 2
    3. step 3
    [Query or Ask User or Docs or Topic or Explain]: <needed input to that action here. enclose SQL queries in 
``` ```> /End
    System: Response to your action here
    Thought: Now that I have done step 1, I will do step 2.
    [Query or Ask User or Docs or Topic or Explain]: <needed input to that action here. enclose SQL queries in 
``` ```> /End
    And so on...

    When you have collected enough information to answer the user's question, respond with:
    Final answer: final answer and explanation here. /End

    Don't forget to end every action with /End.

This is the TPC-H database. It represents a commercial transaction history of a sales business. 
The core of this database is the lineitem table, which describes individual components. Each row of lineitem is
connected to the orders table via the orderkey key. Lineitems are also associated with the parts table, via the partkey field.

The relationship between suppliers and parts is defined by the partsupp table. To know which supplier the part for a lineitem came from,
you need to use the combination of partkey and suppkey on the lineitem.

For instance, if I wanted to know the total number of part with a name "big red wrench" supplied from suppliers in Germany, I would run the following query:

Query:
```
SELECT SUM(l.l_quantity) as part_count
FROM main.lineitem l
LEFT JOIN main.supplier s on s.s_suppkey = l.l_suppkey
LEFT JOIN main.part p on p.p_partkey = l.l_partkey
LEFT JOIN main.nation n on n.n_nationkey = s.s_nationkey
WHERE p.p_name ILIKE 'big red wrench'
AND n.n_name ILIKE 'GERMANY';
```

Customers are associated with orders in the orders table via the custkey field.

If a user asks a question about regions, note that the region is connected to nation via the regionkey field. So you will have 
to join region to nation, then nation to either customer or supplier, depending on which one the user is asking about.

Country names in the nation table are always capitalized. If you are filtering by country name, use ILIKE so the comparison is case insensitive.

If I want to know the total gross revenue from sales of part with name "small flange" to customers in Egypt, my query would be:

Query:
```
SELECT SUM(p.p_retailprice * l.l_quantity) as gross_revenue
FROM main.customer c
LEFT JOIN main.nation n on n.n_nationkey = c.c_nationkey
LEFT JOIN main.orders o on o.o_custkey = c.c_custkey
LEFT JOIN main.lineitem l on l.l_orderkey = o.o_orderkey
LEFT JOIN main.part p on p.p_partkey = l.l_partkey
WHERE p.p_name ILIKE 'small flange'
AND n.n_name ILIKE 'EGYPT';
```

The acquisition cost to our business of each item is stored in partsupp table as the supplycost field, and needs to combination of partkey and suppkey to look it up.
So to calculate the profit of an item, you need to subtract the supplycost field from partsupp from the retailprice field from the part table.

User: How many parts have a price over 1375?

Assistant:  Thought: Let's start by identifying the relevant tables and columns for this query. We will need to join the lineitem, part, and partsupp tables to get the information we need.

Query:
```
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_parts
FROM main.lineitem l
JOIN main.part p ON l.l_partkey = p.p_partkey
JOIN main.partsupp ps ON p.p_partkey = ps.ps_partkey
WHERE ps.ps_supplycost > 1375;
```

Query result:
 num_parts
         0

Assistant:  Explain: The query above joins the lineitem, part, and partsupp tables to count the number of parts that have a supply cost greater than 1375. The WHERE clause filters the results to only include parts with a supply cost greater than 1375. The COUNT(*) function returns the total number of parts that meet this condition. In this case, there are zero parts that meet the criteria.

Ask User: Would you like to see a sample of the data in the partsupp table to understand the structure of the values? 

User: I was interested in the sales price, not the supply cost of goods.

Assistant:  Thought: My apologies for misunderstanding your question earlier. Let's try again.

Query:
```
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_parts
FROM main.lineitem l
JOIN main.part p ON l.l_partkey = p.p_partkey
WHERE p.p_retailprice > 1375;
```

Query result:
 num_parts
    321068

Assistant:  Explain: The query above joins the lineitem and part tables to count the number of parts that have a retail price greater than 1375. The WHERE clause filters the results to only include parts with a retail price greater than 1375. The COUNT(*) function returns the total number of parts that meet this condition. In this case, there are 321,068 parts that meet the criteria.

Ask User: Would you like to see a sample of the data in the part table to understand the structure of the values?

User: That query tells me the number of lineitems of those parts. All I really want to know is how many PARTS there are with that price.

Assistant:  Thought: Ah, I see. Let's modify the query to get the number of distinct parts that have a retail price greater than 1375.

Query:
```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.p_partkey) AS num_parts
FROM main.lineitem l
JOIN main.part p ON l.l_partkey = p.p_partkey
WHERE p.p_retailprice > 1375;
```

Query result:
 num_parts
     10690

Assistant:  Explain: The query above joins the lineitem and part tables to count the number of distinct parts that have a retail price greater than 1375. The COUNT(DISTINCT p.p_partkey) function returns the total number of unique parts that meet this condition. In this case, there are 10,690 parts that meet the criteria.

You do not respond as 'User' or pretend to be 'User'. You only respond once as Assistant, using one of the prescribed methods.
The user is a business user who may need some guidance and exploration to get at what they really want to know. You should think step-by-step before giving a keyword-tagged response to ensure that you provide a logical and helpful answer.
Here are a couple notes about DuckDB: DuckDB is based on PostreSQL syntax, but has many specialized functions. 
You can get a list of tables using "PRAGMA show_tables", but remember you are already given a list of tables and their columns at the beginning of the dialog.
It can be useful to view a sample of output of a table you need for your query to understand the structure of the values.
Keys between tables are likely not explicitly declared. You will need to infer columns for JOINs based on column names and sample column contents.
To do case insensitive comparisons, the use of "ILIKE" is recommended. ALWAYS use ILIKE instead of "=" when comparing strings such as names, countries, business names, etc..
DO NOT use = in your queries to compare strings. Use ILIKE instead.
Use a limit statement at the end of each query to keep the number of output rows to 20 or fewer, unless necessary.
You MUST enclose your SQL queries in 
``` before and after the query.

The permitted responses are as follows:
Thought: <Explain the steps you are going to use to address the users request> /End
Query: 
```<SQL query here enclosed in 3 backticks>``` /End
Ask User: <Question to user here> /End
Docs: (this will display a list of SQL syntax documentation topics, in case you need help with errors) /End
Topic: <SQL documentation topic selection here> /End
Explain: <Explanation of query results here> /End
You may only respond first with a Thought, then by selecting one of the other options. It is absolutely imperative that every action response from Assistant start with one of the above keywords and ends with "/End". Do not repeat any factual information unless you received it after a "query response" flag.

This is the TPC-H database. It represents a commercial transaction history of a sales business. 
The core of this database is the lineitem table, which describes individual components. Each row of lineitem is
connected to the orders table via the orderkey key. Lineitems are also associated with the parts table, via the partkey field.

The relationship between suppliers and parts is defined by the partsupp table. To know which supplier the part for a lineitem came from,
you need to use the combination of partkey and suppkey on the lineitem.

For instance, if I wanted to know the total number of part with a name "big red wrench" supplied from suppliers in Germany, I would run the following query:

Query:
```
SELECT SUM(l.l_quantity) as part_count
FROM main.lineitem l
LEFT JOIN main.supplier s on s.s_suppkey = l.l_suppkey
LEFT JOIN main.part p on p.p_partkey = l.l_partkey
LEFT JOIN main.nation n on n.n_nationkey = s.s_nationkey
WHERE p.p_name ILIKE 'big red wrench'
AND n.n_name ILIKE 'GERMANY';
```

Customers are associated with orders in the orders table via the custkey field.

If a user asks a question about regions, note that the region is connected to nation via the regionkey field. So you will have 
to join region to nation, then nation to either customer or supplier, depending on which one the user is asking about.

Country names in the nation table are always capitalized. If you are filtering by country name, use ILIKE so the comparison is case insensitive.

If I want to know the total gross revenue from sales of part with name "small flange" to customers in Egypt, my query would be:

Query:
```
SELECT SUM(p.p_retailprice * l.l_quantity) as gross_revenue
FROM main.customer c
LEFT JOIN main.nation n on n.n_nationkey = c.c_nationkey
LEFT JOIN main.orders o on o.o_custkey = c.c_custkey
LEFT JOIN main.lineitem l on l.l_orderkey = o.o_orderkey
LEFT JOIN main.part p on p.p_partkey = l.l_partkey
WHERE p.p_name ILIKE 'small flange'
AND n.n_name ILIKE 'EGYPT';
```

The acquisition cost to our business of each item is stored in partsupp table as the supplycost field, and needs to combination of partkey and suppkey to look it up.
So to calculate the profit of an item, you need to subtract the supplycost field from partsupp from the retailprice field from the part table.

User: How many parts have a price over 1375?

Assistant:  Thought: Let's start by identifying the relevant tables and columns for this query. We will need to join the lineitem, part, and partsupp tables to get the information we need.

Query:
```
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_parts
FROM main.lineitem l
JOIN main.part p ON l.l_partkey = p.p_partkey
JOIN main.partsupp ps ON p.p_partkey = ps.ps_partkey
WHERE ps.ps_supplycost > 1375;
```

Query result:
 num_parts
         0

Assistant:  Explain: The query above joins the lineitem, part, and partsupp tables to count the number of parts that have a supply cost greater than 1375. The WHERE clause filters the results to only include parts with a supply cost greater than 1375. The COUNT(*) function returns the total number of parts that meet this condition. In this case, there are zero parts that meet the criteria.

Ask User: Would you like to see a sample of the data in the partsupp table to understand the structure of the values? 

User: I was interested in the sales price, not the supply cost of goods.

Assistant:  Thought: My apologies for misunderstanding your question earlier. Let's try again.

Query:
```
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_parts
FROM main.lineitem l
JOIN main.part p ON l.l_partkey = p.p_partkey
WHERE p.p_retailprice > 1375;
```

Query result:
 num_parts
    321068

Assistant:  Explain: The query above joins the lineitem and part tables to count the number of parts that have a retail price greater than 1375. The WHERE clause filters the results to only include parts with a retail price greater than 1375. The COUNT(*) function returns the total number of parts that meet this condition. In this case, there are 321,068 parts that meet the criteria.

Ask User: Would you like to see a sample of the data in the part table to understand the structure of the values?

User: That query tells me the number of lineitems of those parts. All I really want to know is how many PARTS there are with that price.

Assistant:  Thought: Ah, I see. Let's modify the query to get the number of distinct parts that have a retail price greater than 1375.

Query:
```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.p_partkey) AS num_parts
FROM main.lineitem l
JOIN main.part p ON l.l_partkey = p.p_partkey
WHERE p.p_retailprice > 1375;
```

Query result:
 num_parts
     10690

Assistant:  Explain: The query above joins the lineitem and part tables to count the number of distinct parts that have a retail price greater than 1375. The COUNT(DISTINCT p.p_partkey) function returns the total number of unique parts that meet this condition. In this case, there are 10,690 parts that meet the criteria.

Ask User: Would you like to see a sample of the data in the part table to understand the structure of the values? 

User: Yes

Assistant:  Thought: Great! Let's take a look at a sample of the part table to understand the structure of the values.

Query:
```
SELECT *
FROM main.part
LIMIT 20;
```

Query result:

You do not respond as 'User' or pretend to be 'User'. You only respond once as Assistant, using one of the prescribed methods.
The user is a business user who may need some guidance and exploration to get at what they really want to know. You should think step-by-step before giving a keyword-tagged response to ensure that you provide a logical and helpful answer.
Here are a couple notes about DuckDB: DuckDB is based on PostreSQL syntax, but has many specialized functions. 
You can get a list of tables using "PRAGMA show_tables", but remember you are already given a list of tables and their columns at the beginning of the dialog.
It can be useful to view a sample of output of a table you need for your query to understand the structure of the values.
Keys between tables are likely not explicitly declared. You will need to infer columns for JOINs based on column names and sample column contents.
To do case insensitive comparisons, the use of "ILIKE" is recommended. ALWAYS use ILIKE instead of "=" when comparing strings such as names, countries, business names, etc..
DO NOT use = in your queries to compare strings. Use ILIKE instead.
Use a limit statement at the end of each query to keep the number of output rows to 20 or fewer, unless necessary.
You MUST enclose your SQL queries in 
``` before and after the query.

The permitted responses are as follows:
Thought: <Explain the steps you are going to use to address the users request> /End
Query: 
```<SQL query here enclosed in 3 backticks>``` /End
Ask User: <Question to user here> /End
Docs: (this will display a list of SQL syntax documentation topics, in case you need help with errors) /End
Topic: <SQL documentation topic selection here> /End
Explain: <Explanation of query results here> /End
You may only respond first with a Thought, then by selecting one of the other options. It is absolutely imperative that every action response from Assistant start with one of the above keywords and ends with "/End". Do not repeat any factual information unless you received it after a "query response" flag.

An exchange with a user will be structured as:
    
    User: user question here
    Assistant:
    Thought: Here are the steps I will take to answer the user's question
    1. step 1
    2. step 2
    3. step 3
    [Query or Ask User or Docs or Topic or Explain]: <needed input to that action here. enclose SQL queries in 
``` ```> /End
    System: Response to your action here
    Thought: Now that I have done step 1, I will do step 2.
    [Query or Ask User or Docs or Topic or Explain]: <needed input to that action here. enclose SQL queries in 
``` ```> /End
    And so on...

    When you have collected enough information to answer the user's question, respond with:
    Final answer: final answer and explanation here. /End

    Don't forget to end every action with /End.

This is the TPC-H database. It represents a commercial transaction history of a sales business. 
The core of this database is the lineitem table, which describes individual components. Each row of lineitem is
connected to the orders table via the orderkey key. Lineitems are also associated with the parts table, via the partkey field.

The relationship between suppliers and parts is defined by the partsupp table. To know which supplier the part for a lineitem came from,
you need to use the combination of partkey and suppkey on the lineitem.

For instance, if I wanted to know the total number of part with a name "big red wrench" supplied from suppliers in Germany, I would run the following query:

Query:
```
SELECT SUM(l.l_quantity) as part_count
FROM main.lineitem l
LEFT JOIN main.supplier s on s.s_suppkey = l.l_suppkey
LEFT JOIN main.part p on p.p_partkey = l.l_partkey
LEFT JOIN main.nation n on n.n_nationkey = s.s_nationkey
WHERE p.p_name ILIKE 'big red wrench'
AND n.n_name ILIKE 'GERMANY';
```

Customers are associated with orders in the orders table via the custkey field.

If a user asks a question about regions, note that the region is connected to nation via the regionkey field. So you will have 
to join region to nation, then nation to either customer or supplier, depending on which one the user is asking about.

Country names in the nation table are always capitalized. If you are filtering by country name, use ILIKE so the comparison is case insensitive.

If I want to know the total gross revenue from sales of part with name "small flange" to customers in Egypt, my query would be:

Query:
```
SELECT SUM(p.p_retailprice * l.l_quantity) as gross_revenue
FROM main.customer c
LEFT JOIN main.nation n on n.n_nationkey = c.c_nationkey
LEFT JOIN main.orders o on o.o_custkey = c.c_custkey
LEFT JOIN main.lineitem l on l.l_orderkey = o.o_orderkey
LEFT JOIN main.part p on p.p_partkey = l.l_partkey
WHERE p.p_name ILIKE 'small flange'
AND n.n_name ILIKE 'EGYPT';
```

The acquisition cost to our business of each item is stored in partsupp table as the supplycost field, and needs to combination of partkey and suppkey to look it up.
So to calculate the profit of an item, you need to subtract the supplycost field from partsupp from the retailprice field from the part table.

You do not respond as 'User' or pretend to be 'User'. You only respond once as Assistant, using one of the prescribed methods.
The user is a business user who may need some guidance and exploration to get at what they really want to know. You should think step-by-step before giving a keyword-tagged response to ensure that you provide a logical and helpful answer.
Here are a couple notes about DuckDB: DuckDB is based on PostreSQL syntax, but has many specialized functions. 
You can get a list of tables using "PRAGMA show_tables", but remember you are already given a list of tables and their columns at the beginning of the dialog.
It can be useful to view a sample of output of a table you need for your query to understand the structure of the values.
Keys between tables are likely not explicitly declared. You will need to infer columns for JOINs based on column names and sample column contents.
To do case insensitive comparisons, the use of "ILIKE" is recommended. ALWAYS use ILIKE instead of "=" when comparing strings such as names, countries, business names, etc..
DO NOT use = in your queries to compare strings. Use ILIKE instead.
Use a limit statement at the end of each query to keep the number of output rows to 20 or fewer, unless necessary.
You MUST enclose your SQL queries in 
``` before and after the query.

The permitted responses are as follows:
Thought: <Explain the steps you are going to use to address the users request> /End
Query: 
```<SQL query here enclosed in 3 backticks>``` /End

You may only respond first with a Thought, then by selecting one of the other options. It is absolutely imperative that every action response from Assistant start with one of the above keywords and ends with "/End".

This is the TPC-H database. It represents a commercial transaction history of a sales business. 
The core of this database is the lineitem table, which describes individual components. Each row of lineitem is
connected to the orders table via the orderkey key. Lineitems are also associated with the parts table, via the partkey field.

The relationship between suppliers and parts is defined by the partsupp table. To know which supplier the part for a lineitem came from,
you need to use the combination of partkey and suppkey on the lineitem.

For instance, if I wanted to know the total number of part with a name "big red wrench" supplied from suppliers in Germany, I would run the following query:

Query:
```
SELECT SUM(l.l_quantity) as part_count
FROM main.lineitem l
LEFT JOIN main.supplier s on s.s_suppkey = l.l_suppkey
LEFT JOIN main.part p on p.p_partkey = l.l_partkey
LEFT JOIN main.nation n on n.n_nationkey = s.s_nationkey
WHERE p.p_name ILIKE 'big red wrench'
AND n.n_name ILIKE 'GERMANY';
```

Customers are associated with orders in the orders table via the custkey field.

If a user asks a question about regions, note that the region is connected to nation via the regionkey field. So you will have 
to join region to nation, then nation to either customer or supplier, depending on which one the user is asking about.

Country names in the nation table are always capitalized. If you are filtering by country name, use ILIKE so the comparison is case insensitive.

If I want to know the total gross revenue from sales of part with name "small flange" to customers in Egypt, my query would be:

Query:
```
SELECT SUM(p.p_retailprice * l.l_quantity) as gross_revenue
FROM main.customer c
LEFT JOIN main.nation n on n.n_nationkey = c.c_nationkey
LEFT JOIN main.orders o on o.o_custkey = c.c_custkey
LEFT JOIN main.lineitem l on l.l_orderkey = o.o_orderkey
LEFT JOIN main.part p on p.p_partkey = l.l_partkey
WHERE p.p_name ILIKE 'small flange'
AND n.n_name ILIKE 'EGYPT';
```

The acquisition cost to our business of each item is stored in partsupp table as the supplycost field, and needs to combination of partkey and suppkey to look it up.
So to calculate the profit of an item, you need to subtract the supplycost field from partsupp from the retailprice field from the part table.

User: How many parts have we sold that came from suppliers in England?

Assistant:  Thought: Let's see... to answer this question, we need to join the lineitem table with the supplier table and filter by the nation key for England. We can use a LEFT JOIN to include all lineitems even if they don't have a matching supplier. Then we can count the number of lineitems that have a matching supplier in England.

Query:
```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT l.l_partkey)
FROM main.lineitem l
LEFT JOIN main.supplier s ON s.s_suppkey = l.l_suppkey
LEFT JOIN main.nation n ON n.n_nationkey = s.s_nationkey
WHERE n.n_name ILIKE 'ENGLAND';
```

Query result:
 count(DISTINCT l.l_partkey)
                           0

Assistant:  Final Answer:

We have not sold any parts that came from suppliers in England.

You do not respond as 'User' or pretend to be 'User'. You only respond once as Assistant, using one of the prescribed methods.
The user is a business user who may need some guidance and exploration to get at what they really want to know. You should think step-by-step before giving a keyword-tagged response to ensure that you provide a logical and helpful answer.
Here are a couple notes about DuckDB: DuckDB is based on PostreSQL syntax, but has many specialized functions. 
You can get a list of tables using "PRAGMA show_tables", but remember you are already given a list of tables and their columns at the beginning of the dialog.
It can be useful to view a sample of output of a table you need for your query to understand the structure of the values.
Keys between tables are likely not explicitly declared. You will need to infer columns for JOINs based on column names and sample column contents.
To do case insensitive comparisons, the use of "ILIKE" is recommended. ALWAYS use ILIKE instead of "=" when comparing strings such as names, countries, business names, etc..
DO NOT use = in your queries to compare strings. Use ILIKE instead.
Use a limit statement at the end of each query to keep the number of output rows to 20 or fewer, unless necessary.
You MUST enclose your SQL queries in 
``` before and after the query.

The permitted responses are as follows:
Thought: <Explain the steps you are going to use to address the users request> /End
Query: 
```<SQL query here enclosed in 3 backticks>``` /End
Ask User: <Question to user here> /End

You may only respond first with a Thought, then by selecting one of the other options. It is absolutely imperative that every action response from Assistant start with one of the above keywords and ends with "/End". Do not repeat any factual information unless you received it after a "query response" flag.

An exchange with a user will be structured as:

This is the World Cube Association dataset, built to provide members of the speedcubing
community a practical way to perform analysis on competition information for
statistical and personal purposes.

Most of the tables should be self-explanatory, but here are a few specific details:

### Countries

`Countries` stores include those from the Wikipedia list of countries at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries, and may include some countries
that no longer exist. The ISO2 column should reflect ISO 3166-1 alpha-2
country codes, for countries that have them. Custom codes may be used in some
circumstances.

### Scrambles

`Scrambles` stores all scrambles.

For `333mbf`, an attempt is comprised of multiple newline-separated scrambles.
However, newlines can cause compatibility issues with TSV parsers. Therefore, in
the TSV version of the data we replace each newline in a `333mbf` scramble with
the `|` character.

### eligible_country_iso2s_for_championship

`eligible_country_iso2s_for_championship` stores information about which
citizenships are eligible to win special cross-country championship types.

For example, `greater_china` is a special championship type which contains 4
`iso2` values: `CN`, `HK`, `MC` and `TW`. This means that any competitor from
China, Hong Kong, Macau, or Taiwan is eligible to win a competition with
championship type `greater_china`.

### Results

Please see https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#article-9-events
for information about how results are measured.

Values of the `Results` table can be interpreted as follows:

- The result values are in the following fields `value1`, `value2`, `value3`, `value4`, `value5`,
  `best`, and `average`.
- The value `-1` means DNF (Did Not Finish).
- The value `-2` means DNS (Did Not Start).
- The value `0` means "no result". For example a result in a `best-of-3` round
  has a value of `0` for the `value4`, `value5`, and `average` fields.
- Positive values depend on the event; see the column "format" in Events.

  - Most events have the format "time", where the value represents centiseconds.
    For example, 8653 means 1 minute and 26.53 seconds.
  - The format "number" means the value is a raw number, currently only used by
    "fewest moves" for number of moves.
    - Fewest moves averages are stored as 100 times the average, rounded.
  - The format "multi" is for old and new multi-blind, encoding the time as well
    as the number of cubes attempted and solved. This is a decimal value,
    which can be interpreted ("decoded") as follows:

        old: 1SSAATTTTT
             solved        = 99 - SS
             attempted     = AA
             timeInSeconds = TTTTT (99999 means unknown)
        new: 0DDTTTTTMM
             difference    = 99 - DD
             timeInSeconds = TTTTT (99999 means unknown)
             missed        = MM
             solved        = difference + missed
             attempted     = solved + missed

    In order to encode data, use the following procedure:

             solved        = # cubes solved
             attempted     = # cubes attempted
             missed        = # cubes missed = attempted - solved
             DD            = 99 - (solved - missed)
             TTTTT         = solve time in seconds
             MM            = missed

    Note that this is designed so that a smaller decimal value means a better
    result. This format does not support more than 99 attempted cubes, or times
    greater than 99999 seconds (about 27.7 hours).

Example queries:
User: What were the competitions with the top 5 best times in 2022? 

Assistant: Thought: The user did not specify what kind of event. I will first generate a query to list the events, then I will ask the user which event they are intersted in.

Query:
```sql
SELECT e.name
FROM Events e
```

Query result:
name
2x2x2 Cube
3x3x3 Cube
3x3x3 Blindfolded
...
Skewb
Square-1

Assistant: Ask User: Please specify a competition type from the above list so that I can make a valid comparison.

User: 3x3x3 Cube

Assitant: Thought: Now I will construct a query to answer the users question. 
I will filter on best time > 0 so that only valid results are included.
I will filter on events with format time to exclude results in other formats.
And I will LIMIT the results to 5 rows, to only show the top five.

Query:
```
SELECT c.name, r.best / 100 as best_time_seconds 
FROM Competitions c 
LEFT JOIN Results r on r.competitionId=c.id 
LEFT JOIN Events e on e.id = r.eventId 
WHERE e.name = '3x3x3 Cube'
  AND e.format='time'
  AND r.best > 0
  AND c.year = 2022
ORDER BY r.best
LIMIT 5;
```

Query result:
name, best_time_seconds
Circle City Summer 2022, 3.63
Rose City 2022, 3.89
Rubik's WCA European Championship 2022, 3.97
Cube4fun in Warsaw 2022, 4.02
BC Cubing Springback A 2022, 4.09

Assistant: Thought: I now have the information I need to answer the user's question!

Final Answer: The top 5 fastest times for 3x3x3 Cube in 2022 were recorded at:
Circle City Summer 2022
Rose City 2022
Rubik's WCA European Championship 2022
Cube4fun in Warsaw 2022
BC Cubing Springback A 2022

Now here is the new question from the User:
User: What were the competitions where the top 3 times in 2018 happened?

Assistant: |||end input_prompt|||
2023-09-08 14:30:27,159|INFO|9440cf58-74c2-4091-8ffe-1d4078e51b4d|90520dd7-4155-4d0a-8e8f-08c5599de6e2|input_system_prompt|You are a highly skilled data engineer and analyst, and a User is going to ask you some questions about the data in a database.
You do not respond as 'User' or pretend to be 'User'. You only respond once as Assistant, using one of the prescribed methods.
The user is a business user who may need some guidance and exploration to get at what they really want to know. You should think step-by-step before giving a keyword-tagged response to ensure that you provide a logical and helpful answer.
Here are a couple notes about DuckDB: DuckDB is based on PostreSQL syntax, but has many specialized functions. 
You can get a list of tables using "PRAGMA show_tables", but remember you are already given a list of tables and their columns at the beginning of the dialog.
It can be useful to view a sample of output of a table you need for your query to understand the structure of the values.
Keys between tables are likely not explicitly declared. You will need to infer columns for JOINs based on column names and sample column contents.
To do case insensitive comparisons, the use of "ILIKE" is recommended. ALWAYS use ILIKE instead of "=" when comparing strings such as names, countries, business names, etc..
DO NOT use = in your queries to compare strings. Use ILIKE instead.
Use a limit statement at the end of each query to keep the number of output rows to 20 or fewer, unless necessary.
You MUST enclose your SQL queries in 
``` before and after the query.

The permitted responses are as follows:
Thought: <Explain the steps you are going to use to address the users request> /End
Query: 
```<SQL query here enclosed in 3 backticks>``` /End
Ask User: <Question to user here> /End
Docs: (this will display a list of SQL syntax documentation topics, in case you need help with errors) /End
Topic: <SQL documentation topic selection here> /End
Explain: <Explanation of query results here> /End
You may only respond first with a Thought, then by selecting one of the other options. It is absolutely imperative that every action response from Assistant start with one of the above keywords and ends with "/End". Do not repeat any factual information unless you received it after a "query response" flag.

An exchange with a user will be structured as:
    
    User: user question here
    Assistant:
    Thought: Here are the steps I will take to answer the user's question
    1. step 1
    2. step 2
    3. step 3
    [Query or Ask User or Docs or Topic or Explain]: <needed input to that action here. enclose SQL queries in 
``` ```> /End
    System: Response to your action here
    Thought: Now that I have done step 1, I will do step 2.
    [Query or Ask User or Docs or Topic or Explain]: <needed input to that action here. enclose SQL queries in 
``` ```> /End
    And so on...

    When you have collected enough information to answer the user's question, respond with:
    Final answer: final answer and explanation here. /End

    Don't forget to end every action with /End.

             solved        = difference + missed
             attempted     = solved + missed

    In order to encode data, use the following procedure:

             solved        = # cubes solved
             attempted     = # cubes attempted
             missed        = # cubes missed = attempted - solved
             DD            = 99 - (solved - missed)
             TTTTT         = solve time in seconds
             MM            = missed

    Note that this is designed so that a smaller decimal value means a better
    result. This format does not support more than 99 attempted cubes, or times
    greater than 99999 seconds (about 27.7 hours).

Example queries:
User: What were the competitions with the top 5 best times in 2022? 

Assistant: Thought: The user did not specify what kind of event. I will first generate a query to list the events, then I will ask the user which event they are intersted in.

Query:
```sql
SELECT e.name
FROM Events e
```

Query result:
name
2x2x2 Cube
3x3x3 Cube
3x3x3 Blindfolded
...
Skewb
Square-1

Assistant: Ask User: Please specify a competition type from the above list so that I can make a valid comparison.

User: 3x3x3 Cube

Assitant: Thought: Now I will construct a query to answer the users question. 
I will filter on best time > 0 so that only valid results are included.
I will filter on events with format time to exclude results in other formats.
And I will LIMIT the results to 5 rows, to only show the top five.

Query:
```
SELECT c.name, r.best / 100 as best_time_seconds 
FROM Competitions c 
LEFT JOIN Results r on r.competitionId=c.id 
LEFT JOIN Events e on e.id = r.eventId 
WHERE e.name = '3x3x3 Cube'
  AND e.format='time'
  AND r.best > 0
  AND c.year = 2022
ORDER BY r.best
LIMIT 5;
```

Query result:
name, best_time_seconds
Circle City Summer 2022, 3.63
Rose City 2022, 3.89
Rubik's WCA European Championship 2022, 3.97
Cube4fun in Warsaw 2022, 4.02
BC Cubing Springback A 2022, 4.09

Assistant: Thought: I now have the information I need to answer the user's question!

Final Answer: The top 5 fastest times for 3x3x3 Cube in 2022 were recorded at:
Circle City Summer 2022
Rose City 2022
Rubik's WCA European Championship 2022
Cube4fun in Warsaw 2022
BC Cubing Springback A 2022

Now here is the new question from the User:
User: What were the competitions where the top 3 times in 2018 happened?

Assistant:  Thought: I will first generate a query to list the events that took place in 2018, and then ask the user which event they are interested in.

Query:
```sql
SELECT name
FROM Events
WHERE year = 2018;
```

Query result:
The query returned a DuckDB error message:

Binder Error: Referenced column "year" not found in FROM clause!
Candidate bindings: "Events.id"

Check the SQL query and see if you can correct the issue and try again.

You do not respond as 'User' or pretend to be 'User'. You only respond once as Assistant, using one of the prescribed methods.
The user is a business user who may need some guidance and exploration to get at what they really want to know. You should think step-by-step before giving a keyword-tagged response to ensure that you provide a logical and helpful answer.
Here are a couple notes about DuckDB: DuckDB is based on PostreSQL syntax, but has many specialized functions. 
You can get a list of tables using "PRAGMA show_tables", but remember you are already given a list of tables and their columns at the beginning of the dialog.
It can be useful to view a sample of output of a table you need for your query to understand the structure of the values.
Keys between tables are likely not explicitly declared. You will need to infer columns for JOINs based on column names and sample column contents.
To do case insensitive comparisons, the use of "ILIKE" is recommended. ALWAYS use ILIKE instead of "=" when comparing strings such as names, countries, business names, etc..
DO NOT use = in your queries to compare strings. Use ILIKE instead.
Use a limit statement at the end of each query to keep the number of output rows to 20 or fewer, unless necessary.
You MUST enclose your SQL queries in 
``` before and after the query.

The permitted responses are as follows:
Thought: <Explain the steps you are going to use to address the users request> /End
Query: 
```<SQL query here enclosed in 3 backticks>``` /End
Ask User: <Question to user here> /End
Docs: (this will display a list of SQL syntax documentation topics, in case you need help with errors) /End
Topic: <SQL documentation topic selection here> /End
Explain: <Explanation of query results here> /End
You may only respond first with a Thought, then by selecting one of the other options. It is absolutely imperative that every action response from Assistant start with one of the above keywords and ends with "/End". Do not repeat any factual information unless you received it after a "query response" flag.

An exchange with a user will be structured as:

This is the World Cube Association dataset, built to provide members of the speedcubing
community a practical way to perform analysis on competition information for
statistical and personal purposes.

Most of the tables should be self-explanatory, but here are a few specific details:

### Countries

`Countries` stores include those from the Wikipedia list of countries at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries, and may include some countries
that no longer exist. The ISO2 column should reflect ISO 3166-1 alpha-2
country codes, for countries that have them. Custom codes may be used in some
circumstances.

### Scrambles

`Scrambles` stores all scrambles.

For `333mbf`, an attempt is comprised of multiple newline-separated scrambles.
However, newlines can cause compatibility issues with TSV parsers. Therefore, in
the TSV version of the data we replace each newline in a `333mbf` scramble with
the `|` character.

### eligible_country_iso2s_for_championship

`eligible_country_iso2s_for_championship` stores information about which
citizenships are eligible to win special cross-country championship types.

For example, `greater_china` is a special championship type which contains 4
`iso2` values: `CN`, `HK`, `MC` and `TW`. This means that any competitor from
China, Hong Kong, Macau, or Taiwan is eligible to win a competition with
championship type `greater_china`.

### Results

Please see https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#article-9-events
for information about how results are measured.

Values of the `Results` table can be interpreted as follows:

- The result values are in the following fields `value1`, `value2`, `value3`, `value4`, `value5`,
  `best`, and `average`.
- The value `-1` means DNF (Did Not Finish).
- The value `-2` means DNS (Did Not Start).
- The value `0` means "no result". For example a result in a `best-of-3` round
  has a value of `0` for the `value4`, `value5`, and `average` fields.
- Positive values depend on the event; see the column "format" in Events.

  - Most events have the format "time", where the value represents centiseconds.
    For example, 8653 means 1 minute and 26.53 seconds.
  - The format "number" means the value is a raw number, currently only used by
    "fewest moves" for number of moves.
    - Fewest moves averages are stored as 100 times the average, rounded.
  - The format "multi" is for old and new multi-blind, encoding the time as well
    as the number of cubes attempted and solved. This is a decimal value,
    which can be interpreted ("decoded") as follows:

        old: 1SSAATTTTT
             solved        = 99 - SS
             attempted     = AA
             timeInSeconds = TTTTT (99999 means unknown)
        new: 0DDTTTTTMM
             difference    = 99 - DD
             timeInSeconds = TTTTT (99999 means unknown)
             missed        = MM
             solved        = difference + missed
             attempted     = solved + missed

    In order to encode data, use the following procedure:

             solved        = # cubes solved
             attempted     = # cubes attempted
             missed        = # cubes missed = attempted - solved
             DD            = 99 - (solved - missed)
             TTTTT         = solve time in seconds
             MM            = missed

    Note that this is designed so that a smaller decimal value means a better
    result. This format does not support more than 99 attempted cubes, or times
    greater than 99999 seconds (about 27.7 hours).

This is the World Cube Association dataset, built to provide members of the speedcubing
community a practical way to perform analysis on competition information for
statistical and personal purposes.

Most of the tables should be self-explanatory, but here are a few specific details:

### Countries

`Countries` stores include those from the Wikipedia list of countries at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries, and may include some countries
that no longer exist. The ISO2 column should reflect ISO 3166-1 alpha-2
country codes, for countries that have them. Custom codes may be used in some
circumstances.

### Scrambles

`Scrambles` stores all scrambles.

For `333mbf`, an attempt is comprised of multiple newline-separated scrambles.
However, newlines can cause compatibility issues with TSV parsers. Therefore, in
the TSV version of the data we replace each newline in a `333mbf` scramble with
the `|` character.

### eligible_country_iso2s_for_championship

`eligible_country_iso2s_for_championship` stores information about which
citizenships are eligible to win special cross-country championship types.

For example, `greater_china` is a special championship type which contains 4
`iso2` values: `CN`, `HK`, `MC` and `TW`. This means that any competitor from
China, Hong Kong, Macau, or Taiwan is eligible to win a competition with
championship type `greater_china`.

### Results

Please see https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#article-9-events
for information about how results are measured.

Values of the `Results` table can be interpreted as follows:

- The result values are in the following fields `value1`, `value2`, `value3`, `value4`, `value5`,
  `best`, and `average`.
- The value `-1` means DNF (Did Not Finish).
- The value `-2` means DNS (Did Not Start).
- The value `0` means "no result". For example a result in a `best-of-3` round
  has a value of `0` for the `value4`, `value5`, and `average` fields.
- Positive values depend on the event; see the column "format" in Events.

  - Most events have the format "time", where the value represents centiseconds.
    For example, 8653 means 1 minute and 26.53 seconds.
  - The format "number" means the value is a raw number, currently only used by
    "fewest moves" for number of moves.
    - Fewest moves averages are stored as 100 times the average, rounded.
  - The format "multi" is for old and new multi-blind, encoding the time as well
    as the number of cubes attempted and solved. This is a decimal value,
    which can be interpreted ("decoded") as follows:

        old: 1SSAATTTTT
             solved        = 99 - SS
             attempted     = AA
             timeInSeconds = TTTTT (99999 means unknown)
        new: 0DDTTTTTMM
             difference    = 99 - DD
             timeInSeconds = TTTTT (99999 means unknown)
             missed        = MM
             solved        = difference + missed
             attempted     = solved + missed

    In order to encode data, use the following procedure:

             solved        = # cubes solved
             attempted     = # cubes attempted
             missed        = # cubes missed = attempted - solved
             DD            = 99 - (solved - missed)
             TTTTT         = solve time in seconds
             MM            = missed

    Note that this is designed so that a smaller decimal value means a better
    result. This format does not support more than 99 attempted cubes, or times
    greater than 99999 seconds (about 27.7 hours).

Example queries:
User: What were the competitions with the top 5 best times in 2022? 

Assistant: Thought: The user did not specify what kind of event. I will first generate a query to list the events, then I will ask the user which event they are intersted in.

Query:
```sql
SELECT e.name
FROM Events e
```

Query result:
name
2x2x2 Cube
3x3x3 Cube
3x3x3 Blindfolded
...
Skewb
Square-1

Assistant: Ask User: Please specify a competition type from the above list so that I can make a valid comparison.

User: 3x3x3 Cube

Assitant: Thought: Now I will construct a query to answer the users question. 
I will filter on best time > 0 so that only valid results are included.
I will filter on events with format time to exclude results in other formats.
And I will LIMIT the results to 5 rows, to only show the top five.

Query:
```
SELECT c.name, r.best / 100 as best_time_seconds 
FROM Competitions c 
LEFT JOIN Results r on r.competitionId=c.id 
LEFT JOIN Events e on e.id = r.eventId 
WHERE e.name = '3x3x3 Cube'
  AND e.format='time'
  AND r.best > 0
  AND c.year = 2022
ORDER BY r.best
LIMIT 5;
```

Query result:
name, best_time_seconds
Circle City Summer 2022, 3.63
Rose City 2022, 3.89
Rubik's WCA European Championship 2022, 3.97
Cube4fun in Warsaw 2022, 4.02
BC Cubing Springback A 2022, 4.09

Assistant: Thought: I now have the information I need to answer the user's question!

Final Answer: The top 5 fastest times for 3x3x3 Cube in 2022 were recorded at:
Circle City Summer 2022
Rose City 2022
Rubik's WCA European Championship 2022
Cube4fun in Warsaw 2022
BC Cubing Springback A 2022

Now here is the new question from the User:
User: What were the competitions where the top 3 times in 2018 happened?

Assistant:  Thought: I will first generate a query to list the events that took place in 2018, and then ask the user which event they are interested in.

Query:
```sql
SELECT name
FROM Events
WHERE year = 2018;
```

Query result:
The query returned a DuckDB error message:

Binder Error: Referenced column "year" not found in FROM clause!
Candidate bindings: "Events.id"

Check the SQL query and see if you can correct the issue and try again.

Assistant:  Assistant: Thought: Hmm, it seems like there's an issue with the query. Let me check the SQL syntax. Ah, I see the problem. The column "year" doesn't exist in the "Events" table. I need to use the "year" column from the "Competitions" table instead. Here's the corrected query:

Query:
```sql
SELECT e.name
FROM Competitions c
LEFT JOIN Events e ON c.id = e.competitionId
WHERE c.year = 2018;
```

Query result:
The query returned a DuckDB error message:

Binder Error: Table "e" does not have a column named "competitionId"

Check the SQL query and see if you can correct the issue and try again.

Assistant:  Assistant: Thought: Hmm, it seems like there's another issue with the query. Let me check the SQL syntax. Ah, I see the problem. The "competitionId" column doesn't exist in the "Events" table. I need to use the "eventId" column instead. Here's the corrected query:

You do not respond as 'User' or pretend to be 'User'. You only respond once as Assistant, using one of the prescribed methods.
The user is a business user who may need some guidance and exploration to get at what they really want to know. You should think step-by-step before giving a keyword-tagged response to ensure that you provide a logical and helpful answer.
Here are a couple notes about DuckDB: DuckDB is based on PostreSQL syntax, but has many specialized functions. 
You can get a list of tables using "PRAGMA show_tables", but remember you are already given a list of tables and their columns at the beginning of the dialog.
It can be useful to view a sample of output of a table you need for your query to understand the structure of the values.
Keys between tables are likely not explicitly declared. You will need to infer columns for JOINs based on column names and sample column contents.
To do case insensitive comparisons, the use of "ILIKE" is recommended. ALWAYS use ILIKE instead of "=" when comparing strings such as names, countries, business names, etc..
DO NOT use = in your queries to compare strings. Use ILIKE instead.
Use a limit statement at the end of each query to keep the number of output rows to 20 or fewer, unless necessary.
You MUST enclose your SQL queries in 
``` before and after the query.

The permitted responses are as follows:
Thought: <Explain the steps you are going to use to address the users request> /End
Query: 
```<SQL query here enclosed in 3 backticks>``` /End
Ask User: <Question to user here> /End
Docs: (this will display a list of SQL syntax documentation topics, in case you need help with errors) /End
Topic: <SQL documentation topic selection here> /End
Explain: <Explanation of query results here> /End
You may only respond first with a Thought, then by selecting one of the other options. It is absolutely imperative that every action response from Assistant start with one of the above keywords and ends with "/End". Do not repeat any factual information unless you received it after a "query response" flag.

An exchange with a user will be structured as:
    
    User: user question here
    Assistant:
    Thought: Here are the steps I will take to answer the user's question
    1. step 1
    2. step 2
    3. step 3
    [Query or Ask User or Docs or Topic or Explain]: <needed input to that action here. enclose SQL queries in 
``` ```> /End
    System: Response to your action here
    Thought: Now that I have done step 1, I will do step 2.
    [Query or Ask User or Docs or Topic or Explain]: <needed input to that action here. enclose SQL queries in 
``` ```> /End
    And so on...

    When you have collected enough information to answer the user's question, respond with:
    Final answer: final answer and explanation here. /End

    Don't forget to end every action with /End.

This is the World Cube Association dataset, built to provide members of the speedcubing
community a practical way to perform analysis on competition information for
statistical and personal purposes.

Most of the tables should be self-explanatory, but here are a few specific details:

### Countries

`Countries` stores include those from the Wikipedia list of countries at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries, and may include some countries
that no longer exist. The ISO2 column should reflect ISO 3166-1 alpha-2
country codes, for countries that have them. Custom codes may be used in some
circumstances.

### Scrambles

`Scrambles` stores all scrambles.

For `333mbf`, an attempt is comprised of multiple newline-separated scrambles.
However, newlines can cause compatibility issues with TSV parsers. Therefore, in
the TSV version of the data we replace each newline in a `333mbf` scramble with
the `|` character.

### eligible_country_iso2s_for_championship

`eligible_country_iso2s_for_championship` stores information about which
citizenships are eligible to win special cross-country championship types.

For example, `greater_china` is a special championship type which contains 4
`iso2` values: `CN`, `HK`, `MC` and `TW`. This means that any competitor from
China, Hong Kong, Macau, or Taiwan is eligible to win a competition with
championship type `greater_china`.

### Results

Please see https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#article-9-events
for information about how results are measured.

Values of the `Results` table can be interpreted as follows:

- The result values are in the following fields `value1`, `value2`, `value3`, `value4`, `value5`,
  `best`, and `average`.
- The value `-1` means DNF (Did Not Finish).
- The value `-2` means DNS (Did Not Start).
- The value `0` means "no result". For example a result in a `best-of-3` round
  has a value of `0` for the `value4`, `value5`, and `average` fields.
- Positive values depend on the event; see the column "format" in Events.

  - Most events have the format "time", where the value represents centiseconds.
    For example, 8653 means 1 minute and 26.53 seconds.
  - The format "number" means the value is a raw number, currently only used by
    "fewest moves" for number of moves.
    - Fewest moves averages are stored as 100 times the average, rounded.
  - The format "multi" is for old and new multi-blind, encoding the time as well
    as the number of cubes attempted and solved. This is a decimal value,
    which can be interpreted ("decoded") as follows:

        old: 1SSAATTTTT
             solved        = 99 - SS
             attempted     = AA
             timeInSeconds = TTTTT (99999 means unknown)
        new: 0DDTTTTTMM
             difference    = 99 - DD
             timeInSeconds = TTTTT (99999 means unknown)
             missed        = MM
             solved        = difference + missed
             attempted     = solved + missed

    In order to encode data, use the following procedure:

             solved        = # cubes solved
             attempted     = # cubes attempted
             missed        = # cubes missed = attempted - solved
             DD            = 99 - (solved - missed)
             TTTTT         = solve time in seconds
             MM            = missed

    Note that this is designed so that a smaller decimal value means a better
    result. This format does not support more than 99 attempted cubes, or times
    greater than 99999 seconds (about 27.7 hours).

Example queries:
User: What were the competitions with the top 5 best times in 2022? 

Assistant: Thought: The user did not specify what kind of event. I will first generate a query to list the events, then I will ask the user which event they are intersted in.

Query:
```sql
SELECT e.name
FROM Events e
```

Query result:
name
2x2x2 Cube
3x3x3 Cube
3x3x3 Blindfolded
...
Skewb
Square-1

Assistant: Ask User: Please specify a competition type from the above list so that I can make a valid comparison.

User: 3x3x3 Cube

Assitant: Thought: Now I will construct a query to answer the users question. 
I will filter on best time > 0 so that only valid results are included.
I will filter on events with format time to exclude results in other formats.
And I will LIMIT the results to 5 rows, to only show the top five.

Query:
```
SELECT c.name, r.best / 100 as best_time_seconds 
FROM Competitions c 
LEFT JOIN Results r on r.competitionId=c.id 
LEFT JOIN Events e on e.id = r.eventId 
WHERE e.name = '3x3x3 Cube'
  AND e.format='time'
  AND r.best > 0
  AND c.year = 2022
ORDER BY r.best
LIMIT 5;
```

Query result:
name, best_time_seconds
Circle City Summer 2022, 3.63
Rose City 2022, 3.89
Rubik's WCA European Championship 2022, 3.97
Cube4fun in Warsaw 2022, 4.02
BC Cubing Springback A 2022, 4.09

Assistant: Thought: I now have the information I need to answer the user's question!

Final Answer: The top 5 fastest times for 3x3x3 Cube in 2022 were recorded at:
Circle City Summer 2022
Rose City 2022
Rubik's WCA European Championship 2022
Cube4fun in Warsaw 2022
BC Cubing Springback A 2022

Now here is the new question from the User:
User: What were the competitions where the top 3 times in 2018 happened?

Assistant:  Thought: I will first generate a query to list the events that took place in 2018, and then ask the user which event they are interested in.

Query:
```sql
SELECT name
FROM Events
WHERE year = 2018;
```

Query result:
The query returned a DuckDB error message:

Binder Error: Referenced column "year" not found in FROM clause!
Candidate bindings: "Events.id"

Check the SQL query and see if you can correct the issue and try again.

Assistant:  Assistant: Thought: Hmm, it seems like there's an issue with the query. Let me check the SQL syntax. Ah, I see the problem. The column "year" doesn't exist in the "Events" table. I need to use the "year" column from the "Competitions" table instead. Here's the corrected query:

Query:
```sql
SELECT e.name
FROM Competitions c
LEFT JOIN Events e ON c.id = e.competitionId
WHERE c.year = 2018;
```

Query result:
The query returned a DuckDB error message:

Binder Error: Table "e" does not have a column named "competitionId"

Check the SQL query and see if you can correct the issue and try again.

Assistant:  Assistant: Thought: Hmm, it seems like there's another issue with the query. Let me check the SQL syntax. Ah, I see the problem. The "competitionId" column doesn't exist in the "Events" table. I need to use the "eventId" column instead. Here's the corrected query:

Query:
```sql
SELECT e.name
FROM Competitions c
LEFT JOIN Results r ON c.id = r.competitionId
LEFT JOIN Events e ON r.eventId = e.id
WHERE c.year = 2018;
```

Query result:
             name
       4x4x4 Cube
       3x3x3 Cube
       3x3x3 Cube
       2x2x2 Cube
 3x3x3 One-Handed
       3x3x3 Cube
       3x3x3 Cube
              ...
4x4x4 Blindfolded
       3x3x3 Cube
       3x3x3 Cube
              NaN
              NaN
              NaN
              NaN

Assistant:  Assistant: Thought: Now that I have identified the tables and columns, I can start building a query to answer the user's question.

Query:
```sql
SELECT c.name, r.best / 100 AS best_time_seconds
FROM Competitions c
LEFT JOIN Results r ON c.id = r.competitionId
LEFT JOIN Events e ON r.eventId = e.id
WHERE e.name = '3x3x3 Cube'
AND e.format = 'time'
AND r.best > 0

Query result:

2023-09-08 14:32:01,468|INFO|9440cf58-74c2-4091-8ffe-1d4078e51b4d|619c9a8f-1e39-42c9-b9e1-33d53e0f0de7|input_system_prompt|You are a highly skilled data engineer and analyst, and a User is going to ask you some questions about the data in a database.
You do not respond as 'User' or pretend to be 'User'. You only respond once as Assistant, using one of the prescribed methods.
The user is a business user who may need some guidance and exploration to get at what they really want to know. You should think step-by-step before giving a keyword-tagged response to ensure that you provide a logical and helpful answer.
Here are a couple notes about DuckDB: DuckDB is based on PostreSQL syntax, but has many specialized functions. 
You can get a list of tables using "PRAGMA show_tables", but remember you are already given a list of tables and their columns at the beginning of the dialog.
It can be useful to view a sample of output of a table you need for your query to understand the structure of the values.
Keys between tables are likely not explicitly declared. You will need to infer columns for JOINs based on column names and sample column contents.
To do case insensitive comparisons, the use of "ILIKE" is recommended. ALWAYS use ILIKE instead of "=" when comparing strings such as names, countries, business names, etc..
DO NOT use = in your queries to compare strings. Use ILIKE instead.
Use a limit statement at the end of each query to keep the number of output rows to 20 or fewer, unless necessary.
You MUST enclose your SQL queries in 
``` before and after the query.

The permitted responses are as follows:
Thought: <Explain the steps you are going to use to address the users request> /End
Query: 
```<SQL query here enclosed in 3 backticks>``` /End
Ask User: <Question to user here> /End
Docs: (this will display a list of SQL syntax documentation topics, in case you need help with errors) /End
Topic: <SQL documentation topic selection here> /End
Explain: <Explanation of query results here> /End
You may only respond first with a Thought, then by selecting one of the other options. It is absolutely imperative that every action response from Assistant start with one of the above keywords and ends with "/End". Do not repeat any factual information unless you received it after a "query response" flag.

An exchange with a user will be structured as:
    
    User: user question here
    Assistant:
    Thought: Here are the steps I will take to answer the user's question
    1. step 1
    2. step 2
    3. step 3
    [Query or Ask User or Docs or Topic or Explain]: <needed input to that action here. enclose SQL queries in 
``` ```> /End
    System: Response to your action here
    Thought: Now that I have done step 1, I will do step 2.
    [Query or Ask User or Docs or Topic or Explain]: <needed input to that action here. enclose SQL queries in 
``` ```> /End
    And so on...

    When you have collected enough information to answer the user's question, respond with:
    Final answer: final answer and explanation here. /End

    Don't forget to end every action with /End.

country codes, for countries that have them. Custom codes may be used in some
circumstances.

### Scrambles

`Scrambles` stores all scrambles.

For `333mbf`, an attempt is comprised of multiple newline-separated scrambles.
However, newlines can cause compatibility issues with TSV parsers. Therefore, in
the TSV version of the data we replace each newline in a `333mbf` scramble with
the `|` character.

### eligible_country_iso2s_for_championship

`eligible_country_iso2s_for_championship` stores information about which
citizenships are eligible to win special cross-country championship types.

For example, `greater_china` is a special championship type which contains 4
`iso2` values: `CN`, `HK`, `MC` and `TW`. This means that any competitor from
China, Hong Kong, Macau, or Taiwan is eligible to win a competition with
championship type `greater_china`.

### Results

Please see https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#article-9-events
for information about how results are measured.

Values of the `Results` table can be interpreted as follows:

- The result values are in the following fields `value1`, `value2`, `value3`, `value4`, `value5`,
  `best`, and `average`.
- The value `-1` means DNF (Did Not Finish).
- The value `-2` means DNS (Did Not Start).
- The value `0` means "no result". For example a result in a `best-of-3` round
  has a value of `0` for the `value4`, `value5`, and `average` fields.
- Positive values depend on the event; see the column "format" in Events.

  - Most events have the format "time", where the value represents centiseconds.
    For example, 8653 means 1 minute and 26.53 seconds.
  - The format "number" means the value is a raw number, currently only used by
    "fewest moves" for number of moves.
    - Fewest moves averages are stored as 100 times the average, rounded.
  - The format "multi" is for old and new multi-blind, encoding the time as well
    as the number of cubes attempted and solved. This is a decimal value,
    which can be interpreted ("decoded") as follows:

        old: 1SSAATTTTT
             solved        = 99 - SS
             attempted     = AA
             timeInSeconds = TTTTT (99999 means unknown)
        new: 0DDTTTTTMM
             difference    = 99 - DD
             timeInSeconds = TTTTT (99999 means unknown)
             missed        = MM
             solved        = difference + missed
             attempted     = solved + missed

    In order to encode data, use the following procedure:

             solved        = # cubes solved
             attempted     = # cubes attempted
             missed        = # cubes missed = attempted - solved
             DD            = 99 - (solved - missed)
             TTTTT         = solve time in seconds
             MM            = missed

    Note that this is designed so that a smaller decimal value means a better
    result. This format does not support more than 99 attempted cubes, or times
    greater than 99999 seconds (about 27.7 hours).

Example queries:
User: What were the competitions with the top 5 best times in 2022? 

Assistant: Thought: The user did not specify what kind of event. I will first generate a query to list the events, then I will ask the user which event they are intersted in.

Query:
```sql
SELECT e.name
FROM Events e
```

Query result:
name
2x2x2 Cube
3x3x3 Cube
3x3x3 Blindfolded
...
Skewb
Square-1

Assistant: Ask User: Please specify a competition type from the above list so that I can make a valid comparison.

User: 3x3x3 Cube

Assitant: Thought: Now I will construct a query to answer the users question. 
I will filter on best time > 0 so that only valid results are included.
I will filter on events with format time to exclude results in other formats.
And I will LIMIT the results to 5 rows, to only show the top five.

Query:
```
SELECT c.name, r.best / 100 as best_time_seconds 
FROM Competitions c 
LEFT JOIN Results r on r.competitionId=c.id 
LEFT JOIN Events e on e.id = r.eventId 
WHERE e.name = '3x3x3 Cube'
  AND e.format='time'
  AND r.best > 0
  AND c.year = 2022
ORDER BY r.best
LIMIT 5;
```

Query result:
name, best_time_seconds
Circle City Summer 2022, 3.63
Rose City 2022, 3.89
Rubik's WCA European Championship 2022, 3.97
Cube4fun in Warsaw 2022, 4.02
BC Cubing Springback A 2022, 4.09

Assistant: Thought: I now have the information I need to answer the user's question!

Final Answer: The top 5 fastest times for 3x3x3 Cube in 2022 were recorded at:
Circle City Summer 2022
Rose City 2022
Rubik's WCA European Championship 2022
Cube4fun in Warsaw 2022
BC Cubing Springback A 2022

Now here is the new question from the User:
User: What were the competitions where the fastest 3 times in 2018 happened?

Assistant: |||end input_prompt|||
2023-09-08 15:04:18,188|INFO|fedd0e59-f5f4-473e-833d-f251e7165c4d|1caac21f-577f-4607-bf0e-c0459d58b25e|input_system_prompt|You are a highly skilled data engineer and analyst, and a User is going to ask you some questions about the data in a database.
You do not respond as 'User' or pretend to be 'User'. You only respond once as Assistant, using one of the prescribed methods.
The user is a business user who may need some guidance and exploration to get at what they really want to know. You should think step-by-step before giving a keyword-tagged response to ensure that you provide a logical and helpful answer.
Here are a couple notes about DuckDB: DuckDB is based on PostreSQL syntax, but has many specialized functions. 
You can get a list of tables using "PRAGMA show_tables", but remember you are already given a list of tables and their columns at the beginning of the dialog.
It can be useful to view a sample of output of a table you need for your query to understand the structure of the values.
Keys between tables are likely not explicitly declared. You will need to infer columns for JOINs based on column names and sample column contents.
To do case insensitive comparisons, the use of "ILIKE" is recommended. ALWAYS use ILIKE instead of "=" when comparing strings such as names, countries, business names, etc..
DO NOT use = in your queries to compare strings. Use ILIKE instead.
Use a limit statement at the end of each query to keep the number of output rows to 20 or fewer, unless necessary.
You MUST enclose your SQL queries in 
``` before and after the query.

The permitted responses are as follows:
Thought: <Explain the steps you are going to use to address the users request> /End
Query: 
```<SQL query here enclosed in 3 backticks>``` /End
Ask User: <Question to user here> /End
Docs: (this will display a list of SQL syntax documentation topics, in case you need help with errors) /End
Topic: <SQL documentation topic selection here> /End
Explain: <Explanation of query results here> /End
You may only respond first with a Thought, then by selecting one of the other options. It is absolutely imperative that every action response from Assistant start with one of the above keywords and ends with "/End". Do not repeat any factual information unless you received it after a "query response" flag.

An exchange with a user will be structured as:
    
    User: user question here
    Assistant:
    Thought: Here are the steps I will take to answer the user's question
    1. step 1
    2. step 2
    3. step 3
    [Query or Ask User or Docs or Topic or Explain]: <needed input to that action here. enclose SQL queries in 
``` ```> /End
    System: Response to your action here
    Thought: Now that I have done step 1, I will do step 2.
    [Query or Ask User or Docs or Topic or Explain]: <needed input to that action here. enclose SQL queries in 
``` ```> /End
    And so on...

    When you have collected enough information to answer the user's question, respond with:
    Final answer: final answer and explanation here. /End

    Don't forget to end every action with /End.

This is the World Cube Association dataset, built to provide members of the speedcubing
community a practical way to perform analysis on competition information for
statistical and personal purposes.

Most of the tables should be self-explanatory, but here are a few specific details:

### Countries

`Countries` stores include those from the Wikipedia list of countries at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries, and may include some countries
that no longer exist. The ISO2 column should reflect ISO 3166-1 alpha-2
country codes, for countries that have them. Custom codes may be used in some
circumstances.

### Scrambles

`Scrambles` stores all scrambles.

For `333mbf`, an attempt is comprised of multiple newline-separated scrambles.
However, newlines can cause compatibility issues with TSV parsers. Therefore, in
the TSV version of the data we replace each newline in a `333mbf` scramble with
the `|` character.

### eligible_country_iso2s_for_championship

`eligible_country_iso2s_for_championship` stores information about which
citizenships are eligible to win special cross-country championship types.

For example, `greater_china` is a special championship type which contains 4
`iso2` values: `CN`, `HK`, `MC` and `TW`. This means that any competitor from
China, Hong Kong, Macau, or Taiwan is eligible to win a competition with
championship type `greater_china`.

### Results

Please see https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#article-9-events
for information about how results are measured.

Values of the `Results` table can be interpreted as follows:

- The result values are in the following fields `value1`, `value2`, `value3`, `value4`, `value5`,
  `best`, and `average`.
- The value `-1` means DNF (Did Not Finish).
- The value `-2` means DNS (Did Not Start).
- The value `0` means "no result". For example a result in a `best-of-3` round
  has a value of `0` for the `value4`, `value5`, and `average` fields.
- Positive values depend on the event; see the column "format" in Events.

  - Most events have the format "time", where the value represents centiseconds.
    For example, 8653 means 1 minute and 26.53 seconds.
  - The format "number" means the value is a raw number, currently only used by
    "fewest moves" for number of moves.
    - Fewest moves averages are stored as 100 times the average, rounded.
  - The format "multi" is for old and new multi-blind, encoding the time as well
    as the number of cubes attempted and solved. This is a decimal value,
    which can be interpreted ("decoded") as follows:

        old: 1SSAATTTTT
             solved        = 99 - SS
             attempted     = AA
             timeInSeconds = TTTTT (99999 means unknown)
        new: 0DDTTTTTMM
             difference    = 99 - DD
             timeInSeconds = TTTTT (99999 means unknown)
             missed        = MM
             solved        = difference + missed
             attempted     = solved + missed

    In order to encode data, use the following procedure:

             solved        = # cubes solved
             attempted     = # cubes attempted
             missed        = # cubes missed = attempted - solved
             DD            = 99 - (solved - missed)
             TTTTT         = solve time in seconds
             MM            = missed

    Note that this is designed so that a smaller decimal value means a better
    result. This format does not support more than 99 attempted cubes, or times
    greater than 99999 seconds (about 27.7 hours).

Example queries:
User: What were the competitions with the top 5 best times in 2022? 

Assistant: Thought: The user did not specify what kind of event. I will first generate a query to list the events, then I will ask the user which event they are intersted in.

Query:

Assistant: Ask User: Please specify a competition type from the above list so that I can make a valid comparison.

User: 3x3x3 Cube

Assitant: Thought: Now I will construct a query to answer the users question. 
I will filter on best time > 0 so that only valid results are included.
I will filter on events with format time to exclude results in other formats.
And I will LIMIT the results to 5 rows, to only show the top five.

Query:
```
SELECT c.name, r.best / 100 as best_time_seconds 
FROM Competitions c 
LEFT JOIN Results r on r.competitionId=c.id 
LEFT JOIN Events e on e.id = r.eventId 
WHERE e.name = '3x3x3 Cube'
  AND e.format='time'
  AND r.best > 0
  AND c.year = 2022
ORDER BY r.best
LIMIT 5;
```

Query result:
name, best_time_seconds
Circle City Summer 2022, 3.63
Rose City 2022, 3.89
Rubik's WCA European Championship 2022, 3.97
Cube4fun in Warsaw 2022, 4.02
BC Cubing Springback A 2022, 4.09

Assistant: Thought: I now have the information I need to answer the user's question!

Final Answer: The top 5 fastest times for 3x3x3 Cube in 2022 were recorded at:
Circle City Summer 2022
Rose City 2022
Rubik's WCA European Championship 2022
Cube4fun in Warsaw 2022

This is the World Cube Association dataset, built to provide members of the speedcubing
community a practical way to perform analysis on competition information for
statistical and personal purposes.

Most of the tables should be self-explanatory, but here are a few specific details:

### Countries

`Countries` stores include those from the Wikipedia list of countries at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries, and may include some countries
that no longer exist. The ISO2 column should reflect ISO 3166-1 alpha-2
country codes, for countries that have them. Custom codes may be used in some
circumstances.

### Scrambles

`Scrambles` stores all scrambles.

For `333mbf`, an attempt is comprised of multiple newline-separated scrambles.
However, newlines can cause compatibility issues with TSV parsers. Therefore, in
the TSV version of the data we replace each newline in a `333mbf` scramble with
the `|` character.

### eligible_country_iso2s_for_championship

`eligible_country_iso2s_for_championship` stores information about which
citizenships are eligible to win special cross-country championship types.

For example, `greater_china` is a special championship type which contains 4
`iso2` values: `CN`, `HK`, `MC` and `TW`. This means that any competitor from
China, Hong Kong, Macau, or Taiwan is eligible to win a competition with
championship type `greater_china`.

### Results

Please see https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#article-9-events
for information about how results are measured.

Values of the `Results` table can be interpreted as follows:

- The result values are in the following fields `value1`, `value2`, `value3`, `value4`, `value5`,
  `best`, and `average`.
- The value `-1` means DNF (Did Not Finish).
- The value `-2` means DNS (Did Not Start).
- The value `0` means "no result". For example a result in a `best-of-3` round
  has a value of `0` for the `value4`, `value5`, and `average` fields.
- Positive values depend on the event; see the column "format" in Events.

  - Most events have the format "time", where the value represents centiseconds.
    For example, 8653 means 1 minute and 26.53 seconds.
  - The format "number" means the value is a raw number, currently only used by
    "fewest moves" for number of moves.
    - Fewest moves averages are stored as 100 times the average, rounded.
  - The format "multi" is for old and new multi-blind, encoding the time as well
    as the number of cubes attempted and solved. This is a decimal value,
    which can be interpreted ("decoded") as follows:

        old: 1SSAATTTTT
             solved        = 99 - SS
             attempted     = AA
             timeInSeconds = TTTTT (99999 means unknown)
        new: 0DDTTTTTMM
             difference    = 99 - DD
             timeInSeconds = TTTTT (99999 means unknown)
             missed        = MM
             solved        = difference + missed
             attempted     = solved + missed

    In order to encode data, use the following procedure:

             solved        = # cubes solved
             attempted     = # cubes attempted
             missed        = # cubes missed = attempted - solved
             DD            = 99 - (solved - missed)
             TTTTT         = solve time in seconds
             MM            = missed

    Note that this is designed so that a smaller decimal value means a better
    result. This format does not support more than 99 attempted cubes, or times
    greater than 99999 seconds (about 27.7 hours).

Example queries:
User: What were the competitions with the top 5 best times in 2022? 

Assistant: Thought: The user did not specify what kind of event. I will first generate a query to list the events, then I will ask the user which event they are intersted in.

Query:
```sql
SELECT e.name
FROM Events e
```

Query result:
name
2x2x2 Cube
3x3x3 Cube
3x3x3 Blindfolded
...
Skewb
Square-1

Assistant: Ask User: Please specify a competition type from the above list so that I can make a valid comparison.

User: 3x3x3 Cube

Assitant: Thought: Now I will construct a query to answer the users question. 
I will filter on best time > 0 so that only valid results are included.
I will filter on events with format time to exclude results in other formats.
And I will LIMIT the results to 5 rows, to only show the top five.

Query:
```
SELECT c.name, r.best / 100 as best_time_seconds 
FROM Competitions c 
LEFT JOIN Results r on r.competitionId=c.id 
LEFT JOIN Events e on e.id = r.eventId 
WHERE e.name = '3x3x3 Cube'
  AND e.format='time'
  AND r.best > 0
  AND c.year = 2022
ORDER BY r.best
LIMIT 5;
```

Query result:
name, best_time_seconds
Circle City Summer 2022, 3.63
Rose City 2022, 3.89
Rubik's WCA European Championship 2022, 3.97
Cube4fun in Warsaw 2022, 4.02
BC Cubing Springback A 2022, 4.09

Assistant: Thought: I now have the information I need to answer the user's question!

Final Answer: The top 5 fastest times for 3x3x3 Cube in 2022 were recorded at:
Circle City Summer 2022
Rose City 2022
Rubik's WCA European Championship 2022
Cube4fun in Warsaw 2022
BC Cubing Springback A 2022

Now here is the new question from the User:
User: What were the competitions where the 3 fastest times in 2018 happened?

Assistant:  Thought: I will first generate a query to list the events that took place in 2018, and then ask the user which event they are interested in.

Query:
```sql
SELECT name
FROM Events
WHERE year = 2018;
```

Query result:
The query returned a DuckDB error message:

Binder Error: Referenced column "year" not found in FROM clause!
Candidate bindings: "Events.id"

Check the SQL query and see if you can correct the issue and try again.

You do not respond as 'User' or pretend to be 'User'. You only respond once as Assistant, using one of the prescribed methods.
The user is a business user who may need some guidance and exploration to get at what they really want to know. You should think step-by-step before giving a keyword-tagged response to ensure that you provide a logical and helpful answer.
Here are a couple notes about DuckDB: DuckDB is based on PostreSQL syntax, but has many specialized functions. 
You can get a list of tables using "PRAGMA show_tables", but remember you are already given a list of tables and their columns at the beginning of the dialog.
It can be useful to view a sample of output of a table you need for your query to understand the structure of the values.
Keys between tables are likely not explicitly declared. You will need to infer columns for JOINs based on column names and sample column contents.
To do case insensitive comparisons, the use of "ILIKE" is recommended. ALWAYS use ILIKE instead of "=" when comparing strings such as names, countries, business names, etc..
DO NOT use = in your queries to compare strings. Use ILIKE instead.
Use a limit statement at the end of each query to keep the number of output rows to 20 or fewer, unless necessary.
You MUST enclose your SQL queries in 
``` before and after the query.

The permitted responses are as follows:
Thought: <Explain the steps you are going to use to address the users request> /End
Query: 
```<SQL query here enclosed in 3 backticks>``` /End
Ask User: <Question to user here> /End
Docs: (this will display a list of SQL syntax documentation topics, in case you need help with errors) /End
Topic: <SQL documentation topic selection here> /End
Explain: <Explanation of query results here> /End
You may only respond first with a Thought, then by selecting one of the other options. It is absolutely imperative that every action response from Assistant start with one of the above keywords and ends with "/End". Do not repeat any factual information unless you received it after a "query response" flag.

An exchange with a user will be structured as:
    
    User: user question here
    Assistant:
    Thought: Here are the steps I will take to answer the user's question
    1. step 1
    2. step 2
    3. step 3
    [Query or Ask User or Docs or Topic or Explain]: <needed input to that action here. enclose SQL queries in 
``` ```> /End
    System: Response to your action here
    Thought: Now that I have done step 1, I will do step 2.
    [Query or Ask User or Docs or Topic or Explain]: <needed input to that action here. enclose SQL queries in 
``` ```> /End
    And so on...

    When you have collected enough information to answer the user's question, respond with:
    Final answer: final answer and explanation here. /End

    Don't forget to end every action with /End.

    which can be interpreted ("decoded") as follows:

        old: 1SSAATTTTT
             solved        = 99 - SS
             attempted     = AA
             timeInSeconds = TTTTT (99999 means unknown)
        new: 0DDTTTTTMM
             difference    = 99 - DD
             timeInSeconds = TTTTT (99999 means unknown)
             missed        = MM
             solved        = difference + missed
             attempted     = solved + missed

    In order to encode data, use the following procedure:

             solved        = # cubes solved
             attempted     = # cubes attempted
             missed        = # cubes missed = attempted - solved
             DD            = 99 - (solved - missed)
             TTTTT         = solve time in seconds
             MM            = missed

    Note that this is designed so that a smaller decimal value means a better
    result. This format does not support more than 99 attempted cubes, or times
    greater than 99999 seconds (about 27.7 hours).

Example queries:
User: What were the competitions with the top 5 best times in 2022? 

Assistant: Thought: The user did not specify what kind of event. I will first generate a query to list the events, then I will ask the user which event they are intersted in.

Query:
```sql
SELECT e.name
FROM Events e
```

Query result:

3x3x3 Cube
3x3x3 Blindfolded
...
Skewb
Square-1

Assistant: Ask User: Please specify a competition type from the above list so that I can make a valid comparison.

User: 3x3x3 Cube

Assitant: Thought: Now I will construct a query to answer the users question. 
I will filter on best time > 0 so that only valid results are included.
I will filter on events with format time to exclude results in other formats.
And I will LIMIT the results to 5 rows, to only show the top five.

Query:
```
SELECT c.name, r.best / 100 as best_time_seconds 
FROM Competitions c 
LEFT JOIN Results r on r.competitionId=c.id 
LEFT JOIN Events e on e.id = r.eventId 
WHERE e.name = '3x3x3 Cube'

  AND r.best > 0
  AND c.year = 2022
ORDER BY r.best

Cube4fun in Warsaw 2022, 4.02
BC Cubing Springback A 2022, 4.09

Assistant: Thought: I now have the information I need to answer the user's question!

Final Answer: The top 5 fastest times for 3x3x3 Cube in 2022 were recorded at:
Circle City Summer 2022
Rose City 2022
Rubik's WCA European Championship 2022
Cube4fun in Warsaw 2022
BC Cubing Springback A 2022

Now here is the new question from the User:
User: What were the competitions where the 3 fastest times in 2018 happened?

Assistant:  Thought: I will first generate a query to list the events that took place in 2018, and then ask the user which event they are interested in.

Query:
```sql
SELECT name
FROM Events
WHERE year = 2018;
```

Query result:
The query returned a DuckDB error message:

Binder Error: Referenced column "year" not found in FROM clause!
Candidate bindings: "Events.id"

Check the SQL query and see if you can correct the issue and try again.

Assistant:  Assistant: Thought: Hmm, it seems like there's an issue with the query. Let me check the SQL syntax. Ah, I see the problem. The column "year" doesn't exist in the "Events" table. I need to use the "year" column from the "Competitions" table instead. Here's the corrected query:

Query:
```sql
SELECT e.name
FROM Competitions c
LEFT JOIN Events e ON c.id = e.

Query result:
The query returned a DuckDB error message:

Parser Error: syntax error at end of input

Check the SQL query and see if you can correct the issue and try again.

You do not respond as 'User' or pretend to be 'User'. You only respond once as Assistant, using one of the prescribed methods.
The user is a business user who may need some guidance and exploration to get at what they really want to know. You should think step-by-step before giving a keyword-tagged response to ensure that you provide a logical and helpful answer.
Here are a couple notes about DuckDB: DuckDB is based on PostreSQL syntax, but has many specialized functions. 
You can get a list of tables using "PRAGMA show_tables", but remember you are already given a list of tables and their columns at the beginning of the dialog.
It can be useful to view a sample of output of a table you need for your query to understand the structure of the values.
Keys between tables are likely not explicitly declared. You will need to infer columns for JOINs based on column names and sample column contents.
To do case insensitive comparisons, the use of "ILIKE" is recommended. ALWAYS use ILIKE instead of "=" when comparing strings such as names, countries, business names, etc..
DO NOT use = in your queries to compare strings. Use ILIKE instead.
Use a limit statement at the end of each query to keep the number of output rows to 20 or fewer, unless necessary.
You MUST enclose your SQL queries in 
``` before and after the query.

The permitted responses are as follows:
Thought: <Explain the steps you are going to use to address the users request> /End
Query: 
```<SQL query here enclosed in 3 backticks>``` /End
Ask User: <Question to user here> /End
Docs: (this will display a list of SQL syntax documentation topics, in case you need help with errors) /End
Topic: <SQL documentation topic selection here> /End
Explain: <Explanation of query results here> /End
You may only respond first with a Thought, then by selecting one of the other options. It is absolutely imperative that every action response from Assistant start with one of the above keywords and ends with "/End". Do not repeat any factual information unless you received it after a "query response" flag.

An exchange with a user will be structured as:
    
    User: user question here
    Assistant:
    Thought: Here are the steps I will take to answer the user's question
    1. step 1
    2. step 2
    3. step 3
    [Query or Ask User or Docs or Topic or Explain]: <needed input to that action here. enclose SQL queries in 
``` ```> /End
    System: Response to your action here
    Thought: Now that I have done step 1, I will do step 2.
    [Query or Ask User or Docs or Topic or Explain]: <needed input to that action here. enclose SQL queries in 
``` ```> /End
    And so on...

    When you have collected enough information to answer the user's question, respond with:
    Final answer: final answer and explanation here. /End

    Don't forget to end every action with /End.

This is the World Cube Association dataset, built to provide members of the speedcubing
community a practical way to perform analysis on competition information for
statistical and personal purposes.

Most of the tables should be self-explanatory, but here are a few specific details:

### Countries

`Countries` stores include those from the Wikipedia list of countries at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries, and may include some countries
that no longer exist. The ISO2 column should reflect ISO 3166-1 alpha-2
country codes, for countries that have them. Custom codes may be used in some
circumstances.

### Scrambles

`Scrambles` stores all scrambles.

For `333mbf`, an attempt is comprised of multiple newline-separated scrambles.
However, newlines can cause compatibility issues with TSV parsers. Therefore, in
the TSV version of the data we replace each newline in a `333mbf` scramble with
the `|` character.

### eligible_country_iso2s_for_championship

`eligible_country_iso2s_for_championship` stores information about which
citizenships are eligible to win special cross-country championship types.

For example, `greater_china` is a special championship type which contains 4
`iso2` values: `CN`, `HK`, `MC` and `TW`. This means that any competitor from
China, Hong Kong, Macau, or Taiwan is eligible to win a competition with
championship type `greater_china`.

### Results

Please see https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#article-9-events
for information about how results are measured.

Values of the `Results` table can be interpreted as follows:

- The result values are in the following fields `value1`, `value2`, `value3`, `value4`, `value5`,
  `best`, and `average`.
- The value `-1` means DNF (Did Not Finish).
- The value `-2` means DNS (Did Not Start).
- The value `0` means "no result". For example a result in a `best-of-3` round
  has a value of `0` for the `value4`, `value5`, and `average` fields.
- Positive values depend on the event; see the column "format" in Events.

  - Most events have the format "time", where the value represents centiseconds.
    For example, 8653 means 1 minute and 26.53 seconds.
  - The format "number" means the value is a raw number, currently only used by
    "fewest moves" for number of moves.
    - Fewest moves averages are stored as 100 times the average, rounded.
  - The format "multi" is for old and new multi-blind, encoding the time as well
    as the number of cubes attempted and solved. This is a decimal value,
    which can be interpreted ("decoded") as follows:

        old: 1SSAATTTTT
             solved        = 99 - SS
             attempted     = AA
             timeInSeconds = TTTTT (99999 means unknown)
        new: 0DDTTTTTMM
             difference    = 99 - DD
             timeInSeconds = TTTTT (99999 means unknown)
             missed        = MM
             solved        = difference + missed
             attempted     = solved + missed

    In order to encode data, use the following procedure:

             solved        = # cubes solved
             attempted     = # cubes attempted
             missed        = # cubes missed = attempted - solved
             DD            = 99 - (solved - missed)
             TTTTT         = solve time in seconds
             MM            = missed

    Note that this is designed so that a smaller decimal value means a better
    result. This format does not support more than 99 attempted cubes, or times
    greater than 99999 seconds (about 27.7 hours).

This is the World Cube Association dataset, built to provide members of the speedcubing
community a practical way to perform analysis on competition information for
statistical and personal purposes.

Most of the tables should be self-explanatory, but here are a few specific details:

### Countries

`Countries` stores include those from the Wikipedia list of countries at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries, and may include some countries
that no longer exist. The ISO2 column should reflect ISO 3166-1 alpha-2
country codes, for countries that have them. Custom codes may be used in some
circumstances.

### Scrambles

`Scrambles` stores all scrambles.

For `333mbf`, an attempt is comprised of multiple newline-separated scrambles.
However, newlines can cause compatibility issues with TSV parsers. Therefore, in
the TSV version of the data we replace each newline in a `333mbf` scramble with
the `|` character.

### eligible_country_iso2s_for_championship

`eligible_country_iso2s_for_championship` stores information about which
citizenships are eligible to win special cross-country championship types.

For example, `greater_china` is a special championship type which contains 4
`iso2` values: `CN`, `HK`, `MC` and `TW`. This means that any competitor from
China, Hong Kong, Macau, or Taiwan is eligible to win a competition with
championship type `greater_china`.

### Results

Please see https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#article-9-events
for information about how results are measured.

Values of the `Results` table can be interpreted as follows:

- The result values are in the following fields `value1`, `value2`, `value3`, `value4`, `value5`,
  `best`, and `average`.
- The value `-1` means DNF (Did Not Finish).
- The value `-2` means DNS (Did Not Start).
- The value `0` means "no result". For example a result in a `best-of-3` round
  has a value of `0` for the `value4`, `value5`, and `average` fields.
- Positive values depend on the event; see the column "format" in Events.

  - Most events have the format "time", where the value represents centiseconds.
    For example, 8653 means 1 minute and 26.53 seconds.
  - The format "number" means the value is a raw number, currently only used by
    "fewest moves" for number of moves.
    - Fewest moves averages are stored as 100 times the average, rounded.
  - The format "multi" is for old and new multi-blind, encoding the time as well
    as the number of cubes attempted and solved. This is a decimal value,
    which can be interpreted ("decoded") as follows:

        old: 1SSAATTTTT
             solved        = 99 - SS
             attempted     = AA
             timeInSeconds = TTTTT (99999 means unknown)
        new: 0DDTTTTTMM
             difference    = 99 - DD
             timeInSeconds = TTTTT (99999 means unknown)
             missed        = MM
             solved        = difference + missed
             attempted     = solved + missed

    In order to encode data, use the following procedure:

             solved        = # cubes solved
             attempted     = # cubes attempted
             missed        = # cubes missed = attempted - solved
             DD            = 99 - (solved - missed)
             TTTTT         = solve time in seconds
             MM            = missed

    Note that this is designed so that a smaller decimal value means a better
    result. This format does not support more than 99 attempted cubes, or times
    greater than 99999 seconds (about 27.7 hours).

Example queries:
User: What were the competitions with the top 5 best times in 2022? 

Assistant: Thought: The user did not specify what kind of event. I will first generate a query to list the events, then I will ask the user which event they are intersted in.

Query:
```sql
SELECT e.name
FROM Events e
```

Query result:
name
2x2x2 Cube
3x3x3 Cube
3x3x3 Blindfolded
...
Skewb
Square-1

Assistant: Ask User: Please specify a competition type from the above list so that I can make a valid comparison.

User: 3x3x3 Cube

Assitant: Thought: Now I will construct a query to answer the users question. 
I will filter on best time > 0 so that only valid results are included.
I will filter on events with format time to exclude results in other formats.
And I will LIMIT the results to 5 rows, to only show the top five.

Query:
```
SELECT c.name, r.best / 100 as best_time_seconds 
FROM Competitions c 
LEFT JOIN Results r on r.competitionId=c.id 
LEFT JOIN Events e on e.id = r.eventId 
WHERE e.name = '3x3x3 Cube'
  AND e.format='time'
  AND r.best > 0
  AND c.year = 2022
ORDER BY r.best
LIMIT 5;
```

Query result:
name, best_time_seconds
Circle City Summer 2022, 3.63
Rose City 2022, 3.89
Rubik's WCA European Championship 2022, 3.97
Cube4fun in Warsaw 2022, 4.02
BC Cubing Springback A 2022, 4.09

Assistant: Thought: I now have the information I need to answer the user's question!

Final Answer: The top 5 fastest times for 3x3x3 Cube in 2022 were recorded at:
Circle City Summer 2022
Rose City 2022
Rubik's WCA European Championship 2022
Cube4fun in Warsaw 2022
BC Cubing Springback A 2022

Now here is the new question from the User:
User: What were the competitions where the 3 fastest times in 2018 happened?

Assistant: |||end input_prompt|||
2023-09-08 15:13:23,348|INFO|8244c8f3-750d-427b-bf0e-d7b9051b8896|6076a3c0-05f7-48f5-8ec1-13f17e05b7a6|input_system_prompt|You are a highly skilled data engineer and analyst, and a User is going to ask you some questions about the data in a database.
You do not respond as 'User' or pretend to be 'User'. You only respond once as Assistant, using one of the prescribed methods.
The user is a business user who may need some guidance and exploration to get at what they really want to know. You should think step-by-step before giving a keyword-tagged response to ensure that you provide a logical and helpful answer.
Here are a couple notes about DuckDB: DuckDB is based on PostreSQL syntax, but has many specialized functions. 
You can get a list of tables using "PRAGMA show_tables", but remember you are already given a list of tables and their columns at the beginning of the dialog.
It can be useful to view a sample of output of a table you need for your query to understand the structure of the values.
Keys between tables are likely not explicitly declared. You will need to infer columns for JOINs based on column names and sample column contents.
To do case insensitive comparisons, the use of "ILIKE" is recommended. ALWAYS use ILIKE instead of "=" when comparing strings such as names, countries, business names, etc..
DO NOT use = in your queries to compare strings. Use ILIKE instead.
Use a limit statement at the end of each query to keep the number of output rows to 20 or fewer, unless necessary.
You MUST enclose your SQL queries in 
``` before and after the query.

The permitted responses are as follows:
Thought: <Explain the steps you are going to use to address the users request> /End
Query: 
```<SQL query here enclosed in 3 backticks>``` /End
Ask User: <Question to user here> /End
Docs: (this will display a list of SQL syntax documentation topics, in case you need help with errors) /End
Topic: <SQL documentation topic selection here> /End
Explain: <Explanation of query results here> /End
You may only respond first with a Thought, then by selecting one of the other options. It is absolutely imperative that every action response from Assistant start with one of the above keywords and ends with "/End". Do not repeat any factual information unless you received it after a "query response" flag.

An exchange with a user will be structured as:
    
    User: user question here
    Assistant:
    Thought: Here are the steps I will take to answer the user's question
    1. step 1
    2. step 2
    3. step 3
    [Query or Ask User or Docs or Topic or Explain]: <needed input to that action here. enclose SQL queries in 
``` ```> /End
    System: Response to your action here
    Thought: Now that I have done step 1, I will do step 2.
    [Query or Ask User or Docs or Topic or Explain]: <needed input to that action here. enclose SQL queries in 
``` ```> /End
    And so on...

    When you have collected enough information to answer the user's question, respond with:
    Final answer: final answer and explanation here. /End

    Don't forget to end every action with /End.

This is the World Cube Association dataset, built to provide members of the speedcubing
community a practical way to perform analysis on competition information for
statistical and personal purposes.

Most of the tables should be self-explanatory, but here are a few specific details:

### Countries

`Countries` stores include those from the Wikipedia list of countries at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries, and may include some countries
that no longer exist. The ISO2 column should reflect ISO 3166-1 alpha-2
country codes, for countries that have them. Custom codes may be used in some
circumstances.

### Scrambles

`Scrambles` stores all scrambles.

For `333mbf`, an attempt is comprised of multiple newline-separated scrambles.
However, newlines can cause compatibility issues with TSV parsers. Therefore, in
the TSV version of the data we replace each newline in a `333mbf` scramble with
the `|` character.

### eligible_country_iso2s_for_championship

`eligible_country_iso2s_for_championship` stores information about which
citizenships are eligible to win special cross-country championship types.

For example, `greater_china` is a special championship type which contains 4
`iso2` values: `CN`, `HK`, `MC` and `TW`. This means that any competitor from
China, Hong Kong, Macau, or Taiwan is eligible to win a competition with
championship type `greater_china`.

### Results

Please see https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#article-9-events
for information about how results are measured.

Values of the `Results` table can be interpreted as follows:

- The result values are in the following fields `value1`, `value2`, `value3`, `value4`, `value5`,
  `best`, and `average`.
- The value `-1` means DNF (Did Not Finish).
- The value `-2` means DNS (Did Not Start).
- The value `0` means "no result". For example a result in a `best-of-3` round
  has a value of `0` for the `value4`, `value5`, and `average` fields.
- Positive values depend on the event; see the column "format" in Events.

  - Most events have the format "time", where the value represents centiseconds.
    For example, 8653 means 1 minute and 26.53 seconds.
  - The format "number" means the value is a raw number, currently only used by
    "fewest moves" for number of moves.
    - Fewest moves averages are stored as 100 times the average, rounded.
  - The format "multi" is for old and new multi-blind, encoding the time as well
    as the number of cubes attempted and solved. This is a decimal value,
    which can be interpreted ("decoded") as follows:

        old: 1SSAATTTTT
             solved        = 99 - SS
             attempted     = AA
             timeInSeconds = TTTTT (99999 means unknown)
        new: 0DDTTTTTMM
             difference    = 99 - DD
             timeInSeconds = TTTTT (99999 means unknown)
             missed        = MM
             solved        = difference + missed
             attempted     = solved + missed

    In order to encode data, use the following procedure:

             solved        = # cubes solved
             attempted     = # cubes attempted
             missed        = # cubes missed = attempted - solved
             DD            = 99 - (solved - missed)
             TTTTT         = solve time in seconds
             MM            = missed

    Note that this is designed so that a smaller decimal value means a better
    result. This format does not support more than 99 attempted cubes, or times
    greater than 99999 seconds (about 27.7 hours).

Example queries:
User: What were the competitions with the top 5 best times in 2022? 

Assistant: Thought: The user did not specify what kind of event. I will first generate a query to list the events, then I will ask the user which event they are intersted in.

Query:
```sql
SELECT e.name
FROM Events e
```

Query result:
name
2x2x2 Cube
3x3x3 Cube
3x3x3 Blindfolded
...
Skewb
Square-1

Assistant: Ask User: Please specify a competition type from the above list so that I can make a valid comparison.

User: 3x3x3 Cube

Assitant: Thought: Now I will construct a query to answer the users question. 
I will filter on best time > 0 so that only valid results are included.
I will filter on events with format time to exclude results in other formats.
And I will LIMIT the results to 5 rows, to only show the top five.

Query:
```
SELECT c.name, r.best / 100 as best_time_seconds 
FROM Competitions c 
LEFT JOIN Results r on r.competitionId=c.id 
LEFT JOIN Events e on e.id = r.eventId 
WHERE e.name = '3x3x3 Cube'
  AND e.format='time'
  AND r.best > 0
  AND c.year = 2022
ORDER BY r.best
LIMIT 5;

You do not respond as 'User' or pretend to be 'User'. You only respond once as Assistant, using one of the prescribed methods.
The user is a business user who may need some guidance and exploration to get at what they really want to know. You should think step-by-step before giving a keyword-tagged response to ensure that you provide a logical and helpful answer.
Here are a couple notes about DuckDB: DuckDB is based on PostreSQL syntax, but has many specialized functions. 
You can get a list of tables using "PRAGMA show_tables", but remember you are already given a list of tables and their columns at the beginning of the dialog.
It can be useful to view a sample of output of a table you need for your query to understand the structure of the values.
Keys between tables are likely not explicitly declared. You will need to infer columns for JOINs based on column names and sample column contents.
To do case insensitive comparisons, the use of "ILIKE" is recommended. ALWAYS use ILIKE instead of "=" when comparing strings such as names, countries, business names, etc..
DO NOT use = in your queries to compare strings. Use ILIKE instead.
Use a limit statement at the end of each query to keep the number of output rows to 20 or fewer, unless necessary.
You MUST enclose your SQL queries in 
``` before and after the query.

The permitted responses are as follows:
Thought: <Explain the steps you are going to use to address the users request> /End
Query: 
```<SQL query here enclosed in 3 backticks>``` /End
Ask User: <Question to user here> /End
Docs: (this will display a list of SQL syntax documentation topics, in case you need help with errors) /End
Topic: <SQL documentation topic selection here> /End
Explain: <Explanation of query results here> /End
You may only respond first with a Thought, then by selecting one of the other options. It is absolutely imperative that every action response from Assistant start with one of the above keywords and ends with "/End". Do not repeat any factual information unless you received it after a "query response" flag.

An exchange with a user will be structured as:
    
    User: user question here
    Assistant:
    Thought: Here are the steps I will take to answer the user's question
    1. step 1
    2. step 2
    3. step 3
    [Query or Ask User or Docs or Topic or Explain]: <needed input to that action here. enclose SQL queries in 
``` ```> /End
    System: Response to your action here
    Thought: Now that I have done step 1, I will do step 2.
    [Query or Ask User or Docs or Topic or Explain]: <needed input to that action here. enclose SQL queries in 
``` ```> /End
    And so on...

    When you have collected enough information to answer the user's question, respond with:
    Final answer: final answer and explanation here. /End

    Don't forget to end every action with /End.
